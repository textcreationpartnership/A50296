            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>AFter <hi>Nehemias</hi> had informed himſelf of the men of <hi>Juda,</hi> that came from his country, of the ſtate of his brethren remaining in the land,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2</hi> Eſd. <hi>1, 2.</hi>
               </note> and heard that the remnant left in the Province were in great affliction and reproach, he mourned and lamented their caſe with ſo ſenſible an affection, as the ſad tincture of his heart had ſo much diſcoloured his face, that it ſeemed to have an unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dye to his office of <hi>Cup-bearer,</hi> in the King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his preſence, though God deſigned the drawing great light upon his nation, from out the darkneſſe of his looks.</p>
            <p>This alluſion me thinks may be well fitted to this <hi>Miſſion</hi> of my thoughts into my country; for upon the relations of ſome of our refugi at brethren, comming out of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, of the great affliction and reproach which the remainder of them groane under, and of the demoliſhment of the walls of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I may without affectation, avow the having wept and mourned many

<note place="margin">

            <p>Nevertheleſſe, after this <hi>Injunction</hi> iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>ſpirituall Court,</hi> unto which I deferre all my owne conceptions, I put in this <hi>plea,</hi> for a ſuſpenſion of the <hi>Order,</hi> which may be as pertinently imparted unto you, in reſpect of your reading, as it was ſuggeſted by me, in regard of my writing this <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> this it was, that God had long ago ſet open a <hi>Granary</hi> of this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all food, by the hands of a charitable <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in the time of the firſt famine, that came upon the land in this kind, and this <hi>Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine,</hi> intitled <hi>an Epiſtle of Comfort,</hi> ſtands open and acceſsible to the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb facs="tcp:60051:4"/>and containeth ſufficient proviſions, reſpectively to the exigences of all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo as this <hi>Miſſive of Conſolation,</hi> which ſeemeth but an overlay of the ſame Mettall, might rather ſeeme an exuberancy of Zeale, then an exhibition of a requiſite ſupply.</p>
            <p>To this my <hi>demurre,</hi> I have beene anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the ſpirituall appetite of ſick man, which is your preſent eſtate, muſt be treated, as the corporeall, which is not excited by familiar, though the beſt diet: novelty in theſe caſes is often requiſite to introduce nouriſhment; to which reaſon I did acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce, conſidering indeed that if <hi>Authors</hi> had not ſtill the curious infirmity of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> to juſtifie their labour, in melting and caſting of old matter into new formes and figures to attract curioſity to lecture, even the beſt ſpirits of our dayes, needed not ſaile out of their ſtudies, to venture upon new diſcoveryes, ſince the whole intellectuall Globe of Chriſtianity hath been long ſince inhabited, and perfectly cultivated, by the plantations of excellent Authors: But the nature of man conſidered, I may rather feaxe the finding too many ſick fancies in
<pb facs="tcp:60051:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>theſe evill dayes, longing for variety of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, then doubt that this new transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it ſhould prove redundant to your minds, as already filled with the precepts of <hi>Catholique Conſolation.</hi> Wherefore I may hope the newneſſe of this worke may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile you to the prejudices of ſome novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes you may meet in it, as the ſtrangeneſſe of ſome words, and the errours of a ſtrange <hi>Preſſe;</hi> but ſince theſe thoughts are addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuch as are not likely to proſecute the rigour of the law againſt them, for having taken their character beyond ſea, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into <hi>England,</hi> to aſsiſt their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen by their faculties, I need not much ſeeke protection for the illegall and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable points of the <hi>impreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely conſidering a ſtrange tongue, put into the mouth of the <hi>Preſſe,</hi> a little ſtammering may be tollerated, ſpecially, when the <hi>Errata's</hi> you will finde here, are of a much more diſpenſable kind, then thoſe we finde in your Country <hi>Preſſes;</hi> ſo that even the errours you ſhall meete in theſe leafes, may ſerve towards the deſigne of this worke, of recommending patience to you, while the errours of <hi>Engliſh Preſſes</hi> miniſter unto
<pb facs="tcp:60051:5"/>you provocations, and as I had ſome pain, to make this forraign Mouth ſpeak Engliſh, ſo if I have taken ſome liberty in making Engliſh ſpeak ſometimes forraigne Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I may be allowed this licenſe, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the other part of my conſtraint, eſpecially when I may pretend to the curteſie of a ſtranger, in this point, of excuſing ſome Out-landiſh accent in my tongue, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beene nurſed with many ſeverall milks, and ſucked but little at the breaſts of my Mother; but for that milk, which I have drawn from the breaſt of my ſpirituall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Roman Catholique Church,</hi> I hope in God there is none of that, turned or ſowered by any novelty paſsing through my pen; for this matter can have no ſo ill recommendation as novelty, and variety in this kind were a very ſuperfluous preſent to you in theſe times; wherefore I humbly refer every line, drawn by my pen, to the rule of the moſt holy meaſures, of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> and account this religious defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as the <hi>ſalt</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which is no leſſe requiſite then the frankincenſe, to give it an odour of ſweetneſſe.</p>

               <p>It ſeemeth this weight of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſorrow was all waies in ſo naturall a motion upon the children of God, that it moved the faſter, the neerer it came to the centre, The

               <p>VVHat we have ſaid of our firſt obligation, may well extenuate all we are bound to ſuffer by the ſecond. For when we behold the infelicity of our condition, as we are men, we may well wonder more, that we were preferred to be <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> then that we are continued to be ſufferers. For ſure, if <hi>God</hi> had conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Adam,</hi> after he ſaw his owne nakedneſſe,

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60051:15"/>ſeeing he, who made all by one word could have redintegrated <hi>Adam,</hi> with a word, remaining in the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his divine nature, without the <hi>Word</hi> being made <hi>fleſh;</hi> and being as it were, unmade himſelfe (as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> warrants us to ſay) by taking that fleſh upon him, which was become, as it were, mans priſon, ſo farre was it from being worthy to be the recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God.</p>
               <p>When we conſider then, how God choſe this way of commiferating our nature, not to purge it, by his power, but even by the very infirmity thereof, by taking the paſſibleneſſe of it upon him, we cannot deny, the ſuffering part to be the moſt beneficiall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, ſince God made uſe of that only for the reſtauration of it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the feeling that portion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature upon us, which is the moſt ennobled by Gods election, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, cannot rightly be accounted a prejudiced condition; whereupon we may conclude, that the bleſſing of being <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> may eaſily reconcile
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60051:16"/>us to the obligation of being ſufferers; for what can be the reaſon why <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when by his paines he tooke away the ſting of ſinne, would not alſo take off the points of ſufferings in this life, which are but thorns of that plant, but becauſe his paſſions had infuſed ſuch a quality into our pains, as might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this ſtrange effect in our nature, to make our root the leſſe capable of bearing fruit, by the excreſcence, and growth of theſe ſprings out of it. For temporall affliction ſpringeth cut of ſinne, as out of the root thereof, and nothing drieth up, and infecundateth ſo much the radicall, fructifying vigor of this roote, as the ſpringing up of temporall miſeries and diſtreſſes; ſo as the fruit of ſinne which is death, is killed the ſooneſt by the fertility of ſufferings in this life.</p>
               <p>Since <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath then by the vertue of his Crown of thornes imparted this faculty to the aſperities of our life, of taking off the growth, as his did the guilt of ſinne, we need not wonder, why he hath left all theſe temporall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60051:16"/>bitterneſſes upon our nature, which he himſelfe took, expreſly to taſte of in our nature; ſo as we may be ſaid to become the more <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the more we are called to be Patients. Which Poſition we ſhall find the more cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated to us, the farther we advance into the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he wrote to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> in thoſe times, when in a parallel of your caſes, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immured up in priſons, and partly expelled to the adjoyning fields, thought (it ſeemeth) to ſweeten their condition to them, by repreſenting, that Mortification and Sufferance was their calling and profeſſion.

And while we are in this ſpirituall manner buryed in the life of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, covered and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with indignities &amp; oppreſſions, we are acting that part we took upon us in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> where we liſted our ſelves into that <hi>Militia,</hi> which was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by him, who killed death by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hath left the ſame Diſcipline to all his Souldiers, to deſtroy death by dying to the world; Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therefore muſt needs be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per duties of that ſervice a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is upon, and his <hi>pay</hi> is conditioned ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon his ſuffering, then his acting, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> proceedeth to

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60051:18"/>ſigned to be enjoyed by himſelfe, not to be diſpenſed to others by his hand; ſo as this ſeemeth the gratification of his <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> the having all that treaſure of croſſes he had prepared for other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> appropriated to his owne uſe, whereof he grew ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as in gratitude to this his prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, he returned his <hi>Superabundo gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio in omni tribulatione.</hi>

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 9.15.

It ſeemes the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> did not think any thing worthy to ſtand upon record for CHRIST, that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60051:18"/>was not eminently ſuffering, and therefore paſſed over in ſilence thoſe parts of his life, which we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have been the leaſt diſtreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. If we look upon his way, that is drawn out to us from his Cradle to his Croſſe, we ſhall finde, that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall honour and eaſe were ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with Gods deſigne upon him, as he never had any proffers of them, that did not ſpeedily procure him ſome ſharper vexation. The Star that proclaimed him <hi>King</hi> at his birth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently proved his proſcription to death; and that the law of ſuffering might ſeem enacted in his firſt ſtep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, it was put in execution upon innocent babes, whoſe blood, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, made the firſt tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Chriſtian martyrdome, ſo that the cryes of the mothers and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants followed cloſe the voyces of the <hi>Angells</hi> that glorified him. When the people thought of making him <hi>King,</hi> it put him preſently to flye alone into the mountaines. When the evill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits proclaimed him the Son of God,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60051:19"/>the <hi>Phariſees</hi> doubled their ſpies upon him to traduce him, and ſharpned their wits to enſnare him, by captious que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. His entring into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with the acclamations of <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> haſtned the perſecutions of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and within few dayes the voyces of the ſame <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſtrained higher in the <hi>Phariſees</hi> aire of <hi>Crucifige:</hi> whereby we may conclude, that hee had ſo entirely aſſigned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſufferances, and paſſions in this life, as he did not thinke it a ſufficient diſcharge, to accept the injuries of his maligners, without converting all the dutifull offices of his adherents into ſeed of affliction.</p>
               <p>This was the uneven and painfull way wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> choſe to paſſe through this life, who is the way, the truth, and the life of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and ſince one drop of his blood, had been a price ſufficient for our redemption, ſhall not the effuſion of it all, and the immenſity of his griefs and labours be ſufficient for our example?

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60051:21"/>wonder at any calamity, or tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation whereby he is pleaſed to correct us, eſpecially when it is a marke of our filiation, and fraternity with <hi>Chriſt?</hi> We who cannot be exempt from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings without a miracle, as we are ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhall we be aſtoniſhed at any impoſition, under this notion of Brothers, nay even members of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> In which reſpect S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently, That <hi>delicate and tender mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are not decent and becomming a head ſtuck full of thorns.</hi> Therefore the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and pungencies of this life, make the ſymmetry and proportion of the body of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to the Head, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> who ſince he did not ſo much as ſpeak one idle word, all his praiſes and beatifications of the poore and the afflicted muſt needs verifie the good of adverſity.

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> if it were indifferent to doe, or not to doe as he did? or that it did not concerne thoſe whom he had fore-known and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated to be conformable to the image of his Sonne, in this point, that he might be the firſt-born of many Brethren? Our fraternity therefore is derived to us by this ſimilitude. Our ſinnes might have been effaced not onely by a drop of <hi>Chriſts</hi> blood, but even by a drop of his ſweat; wherefore this ſeemeth one of the chief reaſons that did induce the atrocity of his paſſion, and the auſterity of his life, the neceſſity of ſuch a pattern for our imitation, ſince our nature was grown ſo degenerous and effeminate, as no leſſe then Gods participation of all the ſorts of grievances and injuries thereof would ſerve to forme in us a cheerfull diſpoſition to the ſufferings and infelicities of this life. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not intend to vex us, when he placed our ſalvation in difficulties, and in our natures averſions, for to ſweeten
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60051:22"/>the bitterneſſe of this ſtrong neceſſity, which was to work upon our nature, to purge us from the love of this world, he was ſo gracious, as to infuſe the company of <hi>Chriſt</hi> into this <hi>receipt,</hi> that the taſt of his ſociety might make more pleaſant to us the ill ſavour and acerbity of the remedy. Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may we ſay, <hi>A greater then Eliſha is here,</hi> who hath mended theſe waters by but taſting of them, and hath left neither death nor barrenneſſe in them, for they are become rather waters ſpringing up to life everlaſting.</p>
               <p>And we may obſerve, that in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Gods method with his Sonne, <hi>Chriſt</hi> continued the ſame ſtyle to his Mother, for ſhe, whom all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were to call Bleſſed, was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed any of what this world calls Bleſſings, for She, who had borne the Redeemer of the whole world, was not able to go to the higheſt rate of the Temple, for his Redemption, her poor eſtate did not reach to pay ſo much as a Lambe for the Sonne of God, and the <hi>Lambe</hi> who was to take away the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60051:23"/>ſinnes of the world, had not ſo much as a Lambe for his ranſome. The loweſt price that was ſet for any of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was the rate her low condition was taxed at. None was ſet at leſſe then a paire of pigeons or a paire of turtles, and the Mother of God was in this inferiour forme of the daughters of men. This may ſerve to ſweeten the bittereſt waters of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When we ponder this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would not allow his Mother to taſte of any other ſpring; and though he would not let her taſte of the ſowrenes of the forbidden fruit, yet he fed her more then any other, with theſe bitter leaves which grew out of the ſame root, that is, though he was pleaſed to exempt her from ſinne, yet he would not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with her in ſufferings, which we know are but the productions of ſinne; and ſo, ſhe whom we may ſuppoſe to have been excepted out of the rule of ſinners, was exalted above any in the ſtate of ſufferers. And this ſeems to be very conſonant, that as ſhe was <hi>Mother</hi> to the <hi>Man of ſorrow,</hi> and of no ſinne, ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60051:23"/>ſhe ſhould be a bearer of all griefs, without any guiltineſſe. But howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this point is accorded by all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 2.29, 35.</note> that being the pureſt of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhe was nevertheleſſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all patients. When ſhe came to redeeme her owne Redeemer by the legall ranſome, and was to enter into poſſeſſion of her Son, we may note, that the joyes that were preſaged her, by <hi>Simeon,</hi> in him were very dark and myſticall, but her own ſorrows very cleer and manifeſt. For this myſterie of her having a light to the revelation of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in her armes, and the glory of thy people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was hard to be underſtood of one that was in the loweſt rank of the people; but this part was eaſie to be conceived, of his being a mark of contradiction, and that a ſword ſhould pierce through her own ſoule.</p>
               <p>Nature it ſelfe evidenceth the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which mothers are lyable to from children, and thus ſhe had here her ſorrowes and her ſufferings writ to her in the common <hi>Alphabet</hi> of nature, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60051:24"/>her joyes and conſolations cyphered out onely to her in the figures and characters of grace, which are ſo hard to be decyphered, though it may be ſhe had the key of them. But howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, her faith was to be exerciſed by a tedious, and very ſudden tryall in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. She quickly found the ſword in her ſoule, for we may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what a wound her ſudden flight into <hi>Egypt</hi> was, how many feares, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, and anxieties pierced her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart in that laborious flight. And ſure the ſword of <hi>Herod</hi> that parted ſo many mothers and children, pierced her ſoule even while ſhe poſſeſſed her child: ſhe may well be judged to have out-ſuffered any of them in their own loſſes, for ſhe had the griefe of being the occaſion of them all upon her heart, ſo as the ſword that was drawn directly againſt her ſoule, though the ſtroke did not light upon it, as it was aymed, yet it may be thought to have wounded her in a ſharper manner, then it did any it fell bloodily upon; for her exquiſite charity muſt needs feel all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60051:24"/>their anguiſhes and paſſions who were thus afflicted, as perſonating her.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, how ſhe began her poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her Son, with the ſorrows of a multitude of mothers inflicted on her. And if we look upon her being diſpoſſeſſed of her Son, there we ſhall ſee the ſword piercing her ſoule in ſo horrid a manner, as the paines which all the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ever had, in the birth or death of their children, were but ſhadows of her tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Whereupon S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Neither tongue can expreſſe, nor heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the dolours wherewith the holy bowels of this Mother were excruciated.</hi> Now <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> you pay with rigorous intereſt that pain which Nature was not allowed to exact of you, in your delivery; the pangs which you felt not in the birth of your Son, are infinitely replicated upon you at his death. When we conſider the Mother of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſtanding by the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Son under thoſe nails, thorns, and ſcourges, and all the other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the picture whereof is enough
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60051:25"/>to wound any Chriſtian heart, with what hand can we hope to touch this dolefull figure of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> to give it a lively reſemblance? I will therefore leave it veyled, with this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon it, <hi>Par nulla figura dolori;</hi> the not being pourtraictable, being the neereſt ſimilitude can be made of this figure of diſconſolation. That which reporteth moſt to our purpoſe, is, that by the not being able to comprehend the immenſity of the ſufferings, of the Mother of God, we may be the leſſe apt to apprehend any extremity in our owne; when ſhe, who had at leaſt no actuall ſin to expiate, had ſo much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to exerciſe her vertue, how ſhall we (who have ſo much ſin to ſatisfie for) wonder at any ſufferings, whereof we have ſo much need to ſanctifie us? There is then no reaſon, why we ſhould feare to be miſtaken, in taking croſſes for commodities, indignities for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, poverty for treaſure, ſince the eternall Wiſdome, and divine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hath councelled this accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them, not onely by his adviſe,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60051:25"/>but by his Mothers preſident, and his owne perſonall inveſture of them. He who is both the ſupreme goodneſſe, and the ſupreme power, choſe by thoſe low humbled means to redeem us, and by the ſame we muſt perfect our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the work muſt be finiſhed by the ſame inſtruments by which it was begun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> told his Diſciples, there were many manſions in his Fathers houſe, but never gave them notice of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to any of them, but this of the croſſes and miſeries of this world: And ſurely as he ſaid of the manſions, ſo may we ſay of the marches to them, if there had been another paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, he would have told it them. This narrow way, and ſtrait gate, is all the direction we find, either by his life, his doctrine, or his death.

He ſubmitted himſelfe to vile, and infamous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as to <hi>Malchus,</hi> and to his tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, deriders, and others. He yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelfe even to inanimate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſuffering heat and cold to ſtrike upon him, and by iron, wood, thorns, and reeds, he indured to be violated, and offended; nay he ſubjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his greateſt enemy the Divell himſelfe, when he ſuffered him to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him up to the pinnacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo there is no creature from the ſublimeſt to the meaneſt, from the beſt to the worſt, to whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not humiliate himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee, this arche of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation ſet as it were on another bow, in the clouds of his humanity for

Which conſideration of his ineffable humility muſt needs aſſure us, of that admirable effect it hath produced, of converting croſſes into the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body left upon earth, and ſo to bring that, which ſeparated his ſoule, and his body, now to be the meanes of reuniting the body to the head. For the <hi>Croſſe</hi> is left in his Church, to conjoyne and conſociate the members unto their ſuffering head <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and we may well adde, that this Divine ſigne of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> ſet in the Heaven of his Perſon ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly, remains as a ſenſible marke of his promiſe to the <hi>Church,</hi> of never being drown'd in any inundation of

But alas, all that we can imagin in our own paines, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is imitation of his, is that which we may better bluſh at, then boaſt of, for it is only the guilt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving more then we can endure in this life; this is ſimply ours in our afflictions, wherein we find no reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in the figure of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which part of our caſes, may make us offer up to <hi>Chriſt</hi> a thankfull alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all temporall penalties inflicted on us, for having taken off from us, the burthen we could not remove by any ſufferings, and having left us only ſuch preſſures, as may aleviate the weight of that intolerable gravation, which is the guilt of ſinne: for our croſſes in this life by the vertue of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (whereof our heavieſt are but chippes, or ſhavings) doe not only keepe our ſinnes lower, but alſo weigh againſt the temporall penalty of thoſe,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60051:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>which are in the ſcale.</p>
               <p>It may admit a queſtion, whether it be a more precious Chriſtian exerciſe, to doe good, or to endure evills; That ſtate is certainly the beſt in which both are conjoyned, when ſuffering many grievances, we act as many good as we are able; yet God hath provided mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of meriting in both conditions ſeverally: let them then who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to give to God, by way of actions, rejoyce in the faculty of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, which furniſh them meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offerings in all their neceſſities.

For man hath not only all the ſeverall powers of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60051:29"/>his minde, but alſo the ſenſes of his body given him, as organs of meriting, by carrying the <hi>Croſſe</hi> upon them. With this corporeall furniture, man is enriched above <hi>Angells;</hi> ſo as man may even out of the greateſt infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his conſtitution, extract matter of glorification. This vertue hath been imparted to the vility of fleſh and blood, ſince God vouchſafed to be inveſted in it, our fleſh received this priviledge not only of being admitted into heaven, but of contributing to the ſoule's degrees of glory, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of the bodies fufferings, and as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,

                  <hi>It is no wonder that God, having given his owne Sonne to human nature, ſhould have given all theſe other prerogatives with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of this ſtate of our mortality, the <hi>Saints</hi> ſhall riſe as high, as they ſhould have done from the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence &amp; immortality, which ſhews, that they are equally ſanctified in the brevity &amp; ſhortneſſe of their life now, to what they ſhould have attained in many ages, if they had remained im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60051:29"/>The multitude of ſorrowes and croſſes, by the grace of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> countervaileth and compenſateth the numerouſneſſe of the yeeres of our ſervice.

               <p>All the iniquity of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth either in doing what <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not, or in refuſing to doe what he did, and none can excuſe themſelves, by an incapacity of imitating <hi>Chriſt</hi> in that, wherein he hath been pleaſed to ſtate <hi>Chriſtian</hi> profeſſion; for every one may be poore, and patient, and mortified, but every one is not qualified to attain to riches, honour, or learning.

And thus by the admirable vertue of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Paſſion, it ſeemed not an effuſion, but rather a transfuſion of all the blood was drawne, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into other veynes, and the ſame ſpirits ſeemed to be carryed in it, into other bodies, which ſucceſſively ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſame uſe of it, might make one think, it had been the very ſame blood infuſed into other veyns, which like channels rather then owners of it poured it out againe ſo freely; and in this way of generation, the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> procreated the deſcent of the family of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſeemed to poure out their blood into the veynes of their Diſciples and Succeſſors, and they in like manner to transfuſe theirs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60051:35"/>into thoſe diſcended from them, and by this ſucceſſive tranſmiſſion, the Progeny of the <hi>Church</hi> was deduced through the Primitive Perſecutions. This was the operation of that <hi>one heart,

<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Hic eſt Joannes Baptiſta, ipſe ſurrexit à mortuis, ideo virtutes ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur in eo.</hi> The doctrine of tranſition of ſoules from one body to another was much followed in thoſe times. But we may wel in a pious and ſober ſenſe, ſay, that the ſoule of S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeemed tranſmigrated into his ſucceſſors for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60051:35"/>many yeeres, for the ſame ſpirit of fervour, in watering with their blood the Rock whereon <hi>Chriſt</hi> had planted his <hi>Church,</hi> poſſeſſed above thirty <hi>Popes</hi> ſucceſſively after S. <hi>Peter;</hi> and ſo all their bodies ſeemed to be caſt as a mold of earth upon that rock, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>Romane Church</hi> did ſpring; the plants whereof, even all acknowledge their <hi>Churches</hi> to be, who have now ſevered themſelves from that radicall communion, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the benefits of thoſe <hi>Joſephs,</hi> who ſed them in the famine of their <hi>Faga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> are now laying burthens on their children.</p>
               <p>In this manner, the Primitive <hi>Church</hi> was nouriſhed in her cradle; inſtead of having milk given her to make blood of, ſhe ſucked blood, and made milke of it, by the which ſhe hath nurſed the ſucceeding times; for in all the <hi>Churches</hi> following perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the faithfull have been ſuſtained and refreſhed by that milk, which the blood of thoſe times did make for them, for their examples deſcending
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60051:36"/>with their doctrines, hath confirmed and ſtrengthned as well as alimented all their future progenie. It is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable evincement of the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, to remark, that as it was founded upon a ſupernaturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of a body that might ſuffer, to a perſon that was impaſſible; ſo it was propagated by the deſtruction of thoſe bodies, which were the organs of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it to poſterity, for the wounds of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and the <hi>Martyrs</hi> ſeemed but ſo many more mouthes, opened to ſpeak out louder the myſteries of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and to prove thoſe verities by daring to dye for them, which were not to be demonſtrated by the cloquence of any living men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and thus the tongues of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> ſpoke more plainly the myſteries of their faith, when they were torne out of their mouthes by their tortures, then while they were tutoring their Diſciples.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60051:36"/>the more efficacious allurement it proved to Chriſtian Religion. For, as he explains it, every one being ſtruck with wonder at the vertue and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſufferers, began to think that worthy the enquiring into, which men thought ſo much better worth then their lives; and theſe reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons converted more then the beſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball expreſſions, to ſuch auditors, as thought life not to be equivalenced by any compenſation. Wherefore Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who was one of the brighteſt mirrors of theſe reflections, ſaith, <hi>The Heathen were wont to conclude, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be ſtudyed, and fully penetrated, that perſwaſion which could induce a man to ſuffer ſo much, and to dye ſo willingly.</hi> And this Lecture of the bodies of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> convinced more then the books of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> it wrought more upon fleſh and blood, to ſee as it were the whole body ſet to their faith, then the ſingle hand; as we ſaw in <hi>Malta,</hi> the Vipers teeth moved them more then S. <hi>Pauls</hi> tongue; and in like manner, this wrought thoſe preſent effects fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

               <p>This alſo deſerveth our animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that ſoone after the <hi>Church</hi> came to ſuck at thoſe breſts, ſhe fell into fits of Convulſion, interiour Hereſies, which endangered, her more then all the exteriour wounds of Perſecution ſhe had received.

This perill ſprang out of Proſperity, when the

                  <hi>Emperours</hi> of the Eaſt, ſeemed to think their Religion ſupported ſtrongly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough without the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereas <hi>Rome,</hi> which was then fallen away in all temporall diminution, maintained the intire profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith, againſt all the gates of hell, which the <hi>Emperours</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being watchmen upon the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, had opened againſt her, and for many yeares, S. <hi>Peters</hi> barke floated as it were in an Ocean of <hi>Arianiſme,</hi> which had covered the Eaſtern, and had broke in upon many parts of the Weſtern Empire.

Wherefore S. <hi>Gregory</hi> upon <hi>Jobs</hi> ſcraping his ſoares with a piece of a broken pot, ſaith, <hi>He made clean one dirt with another;</hi> for the holy man reflected from whence that was taken which he wore, and with a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one piece of clay he ſcrapes another broken veſſell, ſo as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe in that fragment of clay, in the cleanſing and exterſion of his ſores, he did alſo dreſſe and medicine his minde. And this is a ready re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, which we have alwaies by us, when we are upon our dunghill, to wipe and cleanſe the corruption of our ſores, with this recogitation of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our nature, which is as naturally liable to this breaking out into ulcers of miſeries and tribulations, as earthen pots are to be broken. Therefore we may learn of <hi>Job</hi> to take off the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, and ordure from our ſores, which is murmur, and repining, with this recollection, that we ſuffer it in order to our nature, and ſo reluctancy to this condition, may, in this reſpect, ſeeme more unnaturall then reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>

<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. In all things we ſuffer tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, but are not in diſtreſs; alwayes bearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> that the life of <hi>Jeſus</hi> may be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in our bodies.</note> as knowing they are appointed to tribulations; And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a diſcharge of this obligation, he exhibiteth to us the ſtate of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, In omnibus tribulationem patimur, ſed non anguſtiamur, ſemper mortificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Jeſu in corpore noſtro circumferentes, ut vita Jeſu manifeſtetur in corporibus noſtris.</hi> So as we ſee, a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is to coppy, and manifeſt the life of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and we cannot render it ſo eaſie to be known by any way, as by having his moſt notorious markes viſibly upon it, which are Croſſes: for we cannot poſſibly draw the figure ſo reſembling in ſanctity as in ſuffering, (for our bodies are helps to us in this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as impediments in the other.) We muſt then ſeeke to finiſh this fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as exactly as we can, ſince in this reſpect we muſt be all <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and thus theſe times may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duce to the making you all <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> according to this order
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60051:40"/>of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> And if you enter piouſly into this ſociety of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> you will not feare how you ſtay here, or when you remove from the ſociety of men; for if you have the figure of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon you, in any preſſure whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or cut out in you, by the ſharpeſt violences, you ſhall riſe from the want of bread, up to that nuptiall feaſt, in which your preſent nakedneſſe ſhall paſſe for your Wedding garment, and from the bar of men you ſhalbe called up to the throne it ſelfe, where the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified</hi> ſits to condemne all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not with that impreſſion on them.</p>
               <p>This beleefe of a <hi>Chriſtian's</hi> being preſſed to ſerve under the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> was ſo received in the Primitive times, as S. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who lived in the age of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when he was firſt bound, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that then he began firſt to be a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to this opinion telleth one, <hi>That if he had not yet beene entred by any tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, he had not begun to be a Chriſtian;</hi> and Saint <hi>Martin</hi> was ſo imbued with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60051:41"/>this Doctrine, as when the Divell ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him in a glorious forme, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting to him that it was an appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt doth not appeare to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in this life, but on the Croſſe.</note> he anſwered, <hi>Chriſtus non niſi in cruce apparet ſuis in hac vitâ,</hi> intimating, that a Chriſtian muſt not underſtand felicity in this life, to be a proper image to repreſent <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his ſervants. And it referreth to this, what is recorded of <hi>Chriſts</hi> apparition to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was ſtying out of Priſon in <hi>Rome,</hi> by much perſwaſion of the Chriſtians a little before his Mar tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> met him with a ſad afflicted countenance, and being asked by S. <hi>Peter</hi> whither he was going? He anſwered, <hi>To be crucified againe:</hi> by which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> underſtood his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters order, and obeyed it cheer fully, returning back to the Priſon, and ſoon after to the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> which was annexed to his Commiſſion of <hi>Paſce oves meas,</hi>

Whereupon S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> adviſeth us, not to conſider what paine we have under the rod, but what part we have in the <hi>Will.</hi> And for this cauſe, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> were not ſtyled by <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

               <p>And we may note, that of the eight ſtates of <hi>Beatitude</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> foure of them conſiſt directly in ſuffering, and that thoſe alſo that are ſomewhat referred to action, (which are the being mercifull, and the being peace makers) are made half alſo of paſſive matter. For there muſt be miſery and troubles, for the ſubjects of mercy and pacification. And for that of ſpirituall hunger and thirſt, it is ſet after poverty and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as if they had got us this good appetite; and the other of purity of heart, comes in as it were after the ſoules having beene ſtrained through thoſe preſſures, as though this paſſing of it, were requiſite to bring the heart to this cleanneſſe, and depuration; and when we conſider <hi>Chriſts</hi> life, how he walked himſelfe in this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way to this beatitude, we cannot reply againſt this order of following him through many tribulations into
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60051:42"/>his Kingdome, for if <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered ſo much that he might juſtly give us his glory, what ought not we to doe and ſuffer that we may receive it? It muſt needs be then a great folly, to imagine we can attain this glory without pains, when even God laboured and ſuffered ſo much that he might diſpoſe of it. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe telleth us,

                  <hi>Chriſt humbled himſelfe made obedient to death, even the death of the croſſe, for the which thing God hath exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him.</hi> So that here <hi>Chriſts</hi> power is referred to his purchaſe of it by his paſſions.

In like manner, if the weight of your preſent croſſes lye upon the ſenſitive part of your ſoules, and you conſider them meerly as ſenſible oppreſſions and gravations in this world, fleſh and blood will be dejected, and ſunk by them; when that feeleth all the charge upon it, the mind may eaſily be caſt downe by the heavineſſe of the ſenſes; but if you lay your minds upon your
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60051:44"/>croſſes, that is, extend your thoughts orderly upon the meditation of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from which all yours derive a vertue and efficacie to work upon you, the image of the Sonne of God, laying your minds in this poſture upon your croſſes, they will beare up your hearts inſtead of ſinking them; and thus this ſtorme ſhall but drowne your worldly and earthly affections, and your croſſes in this poſture under your minds, ſhall carry and land you in the land of the living. Wherefore I beſeech you to caſt your thoughts in this poſture upon the <hi>Croſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

               <p>IN my preceding diſcourſe, having (I hope in God) ſufficiently proved this your ſecond bond of ſufferance by the two irrecuſable witneſſes of <hi>Chriſts</hi> life, and his death, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to put the third in ſuit againſt any reluctant and querulous humor which fleſh and blood may breed in you to plead againſt your ſpirituall conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to your temporall condition; that in poverty of ſpirit you may be ſuited to the penury of your fortunes, when you conſider ſeriouſly your ſelves bound by this triple cord to croſſes &amp; adverſities in this life. The third of your <hi>Covenants</hi> I propoſed to you, was, the being <hi>Catholiques,</hi> which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemeth to be like the wheele in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60051:45"/>the middle of a wheele in <hi>EZekiels</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the greater circle of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> as a leſſer ſphere within a larger: and we may properly ſay that the ſpirit of life is in this ſmaller wheele; for the being a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in the large acception of it, will admit many ſtations of Religions, without the incloſure of the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> wherein the <hi>Symbol</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circleth the true <hi>Chriſtian Faith;</hi> and becauſe this terme, <hi>Catholike,</hi> is now the notionall diſtinction of your true Religion, from all other, whoſe ſects are comprehended in the amplitude of the terme <hi>(Chriſtian)</hi> it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to explain unto you in a few words the <hi>Churches</hi> ſenſe of this deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>Catholike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We know the firſt followers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were called <hi>Diſciples;</hi> It ſeemeth <hi>Chriſts</hi> humility would not admit ſo much honour in his life, as the faming of his name by this celebration of it, which men affect eſpecially to ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the front of their intellectuall edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60051:45"/>for <hi>Chriſt</hi> all his life endured the meanneſſe of his earthly habitation to be branded upon his <hi>Diſciples</hi> who were called <hi>Nazareans,</hi> or <hi>Galileans,</hi> rather then the gloriouſneſſe of his office to be charactered upon them. For his ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is <hi>Anointed,</hi> hath a reference to the higheſt dignities of the world; ſo as it was long after his death, before he admitted his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to that honourable name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> for you know it was at <hi>Antioch</hi> that the <hi>Diſciples</hi> began firſt to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and he who never ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, was early up ſowing tares, for <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 11.26</note> who was his firſt ſeeds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſowed even in the ſame furrows the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were plowing, and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers wore the badge of his name, and many other <hi>Hereſies</hi> ſprang pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently up, all which covered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with this large cloake of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;</hi> in ſo much as the name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> was juſtly odious in that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had of it. For the <hi>Hereſies</hi> that were clothed with that upper garment, were in their owne
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60051:46"/>nakedneſſe, foule and execrable in all ſorts of pollutions.

               <p>The word, <hi>Catholike,</hi> ſignifieth lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, <hi>Univerſall,</hi> and was meant to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that faith to be onely ſincerely <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> which was univerſally and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60051:46"/>unanimouſly promulgated by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> and conſerved by the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat and fidelities of their diſciples, and ſo tranſmitted by all the concurrent te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of that age to the next ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it. So as the <hi>Church</hi> is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Catholike</hi> for the actuall extention of it into all nations, but as the major part in reſpect of all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſocieties, or in reference to the promiſe of this expanſion over the whole world. So that it hath alwaies been one of the viſible markes of the <hi>Church,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt ſociety of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of any one communion. And as all ſects came out of the true <hi>Church</hi> ſhe retaineth ſtill the name of the whole, as the body of the tree doth after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny branches are torn off from it. So as the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> neither is, nor ever was a comprehender of all the ſects of Chriſtians, but a compriſer of a greater portion of them, then any other profeſſion which was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from her; and this majority the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> hath had in all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> ages. When we ſay then the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60051:47"/>
                  <hi>Roman Catholicke Church,</hi> we doe not meane to exclude all Churches from being <hi>Catholike</hi> beſides the locall <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> but as that is the head, and ſpring of <hi>Catholike</hi> communion, by way of dignity and preference above all other particular <hi>Churches,</hi> we give <hi>Rome</hi> that ſingle appellation, as the head of all other <hi>Churches,</hi> or by reaſon of the derivation of the <hi>Catholick</hi> faith from her to the reſt of the <hi>Churches</hi> of the world, as being the Chaire of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who was conſtituted head of the <hi>Univerſall Church,</hi> and as the ſame authority and prerogative is deſcended upon his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in theſe reſpects, in regard no <hi>Church</hi> is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor is <hi>Catholicke,</hi> that doth not adhere to her communion, we ſtile the particular <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Catholike Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if we ſpeake formally and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> ſignifies the body of all particular <hi>Churches</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in communion with the <hi>Vniverſall,</hi> and by way of participation any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60051:47"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> may be called <hi>Catholicke</hi> as it partakes with the intire body. In this reſpect the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeparation was a <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> and ſo are all <hi>Churches</hi> which remaine united to the <hi>Catholike</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. So as when you heare it objected that <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Catholike</hi> ſeem as incompatible as particular and <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall,</hi> you may ſatisfy your ſelves, that <hi>Rome</hi> doth not claime the title in that contradictory ſenſe, to ſay that the ſingle and locall <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>Univerſall Church,</hi> but that <hi>Rome</hi> is the head of the <hi>Univerſall Church,</hi> in which all particular ones are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Catholike</hi> (in this ſenſe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and true Churches) as they are united to that head. If the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> acknowledged any one particular <hi>Church</hi> to be the head of their communion, that <hi>Church</hi> might be ſaid to be the <hi>Univerſall Proteſtant Church</hi> by way of eminency; and in this ſenſe the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is ſtiled the <hi>Univerſall</hi> or <hi>Catholike Church.</hi> I have ſaid this as falling within the verge of

So as it is not the inſufficiency of <hi>Chriſts</hi> paſſions that needs a ſupplement of his <hi>Churches</hi> preſſures, but the order of God, who
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60051:50"/>hath deſigned the application of <hi>Chriſts</hi> paſſions and merits to his <hi>Church</hi> by this her conformity to his paſſive pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrination through this world.</p>
               <p>And may we not ſay, that to unite his <hi>Church</hi> the more firmly to him, he hath left her faſtned to the <hi>Croſſe</hi> upon earth, that this his body might ſeeme to be ſo much his owne, as it might appear rather his naturall body crucified, then onely a myſticall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification thereof?

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60051:51"/>that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to have a continuall view of the glory of his ſuffering bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hath leſt his <hi>Church</hi> in a bleeding poſture, to preſent God his Father with a perpetuall ſhow not only of a picture, or image, but as it were a reall exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf ſuffering in his <hi>Church;</hi> and no ſight propitiateth God to the ſonnes of men ſo much, as this of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as it were acting the ſons of God, under this notion of hoaſts and ſacrifices. In the quotidian unbloody ſacrifice of his now impaſſible body, the offering is of more dignity, but the object ſeemeth not ſo affecting, and moving compaſſion, as the torne and wounded figure of his <hi>Churches</hi> tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, the body whereof ſeemeth to be deſigned to bleed continually for a lively memoriall of <hi>Chriſts</hi> merits in the ſight of God, and for a ſolicitor of an effuſion of freſh graces, upon the neceſſities of this body, untill the bleeding and the beatify'd body be both united into one conformity of glory.</p>
               <p>This is the order God ſeemes to

Which conſideration may eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to acquieſce to the order of the ſufferances of the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> ſince the preſſures thereof are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued memories or imitations of that object which is ſo pleaſing to God, the paſsions of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but even accompliſhments of what was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his paſsions, (according to the meaning of S. <hi>Paul</hi> before related) which was the finiſhing and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the effect of his ſufferings, by rendring the body ſo fit for the head, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> may have glory by the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60051:52"/>of this work, as wel as the <hi>Church</hi> beatitude by this ſutable incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration.</p>

With good reaſon therefore, as the head of the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> was once victimated and offered up in bloud to the glory of his head,
<note place="margin">a 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4.</note> who is God, it is but juſt that the body ſhould be continually immolated, as a bleeding hoaſt to the glory of his head, who is <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Whereupon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſing the proper ſtate of the <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11.</note> ſaith, <hi>We that live are alwayes delivered unto death for JESUS, that the life of JESUS may be manifeſted

Doth not then the ſuffering <hi>Church</hi> rememorate to God continually the higheſt point of all his glory? For the holocauſting or incineration of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite worlds, in honour of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60051:53"/>of God, would not have been an oblation equivalent to the leaſt drop of blood drawne from the perſon of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and therefore <hi>Chriſts</hi> deſigne in leaving his myſticall body in a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering poſture, is one of the higheſt ſtraines of his divine providence, both in order to the honouring of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

               <p>It is obſervable, how to that <hi>Church</hi> of God, to which no temporall ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were medicinally appointed, there was no reward but temporall felicity manifeſtly propoſed: for as all the ſacrifices of the temple were but figures of the blood of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> ſo all their promiſes were but darke ſhadowes of heaven, the which is as much cleerer, and better expoſed to us, as the ſufferings of men are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyer then thoſe of beaſts; and it was but juſt, that they who had but water appointed for moſt of their purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inſtead of the fire of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and mortification, ſhould have but earth meaſured out to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their poſſeſſions, when the others who had all ſorts of afflictions preſcribed to them, had heaven fairly laid open to their expectations.

                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:60051:59"/>in the ſight of God, and the taſting the grapes and figs of <hi>Canaan,</hi> conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned with the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then there is between the being but aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with blood from the hand of a Prieſt, and the being our ſelves the bloody ſacrifices.</p>
               <p>All our ſufferings are then compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated by that meaſure of joy, running o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into our boſomes, which is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of becomming Gods, while the acquiſitions propoſed to our elder brothers, were but the proſperities of men. Wherefore we may note, that untill the <hi>Croſſe</hi> had opened the gates of heaven, God did not make that, the key, wherewith his children were ſo preciſely ordained to unlock them. For the ancient <hi>Patriarks</hi> who were to ſtay long without the doores were not ſet to forge this key out of the fire of tribulation, with ſo much ſweat and labour, as thoſe who were preſently to be let in upon the perfecting of their worke preſcribed in the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> And ſo we may obſerve a far differing order in the promulgation of the <hi>Law,</hi> and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60051:60"/>of the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> For to the <hi>Generalls</hi> of the Law, there was given a promiſe of great temporall victories, triumphs, and ſubjugations of their enemies, but we know the <hi>Champions</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> had very different <hi>Commiſsions,</hi> which conſiſted in all temporal ſufferings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>features and diſtreſſes.

               <p>In like manner there may be many who have heard much of our expoſure to ſufferings and afflictions in this life, and yet remain little inlightned in the right conception of them; and which is worſe, little inquiſitive of that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, whereby we muſt extract bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and utility out of them. Wherefore it is requiſite to exhibit as faire a copy of that method as I can let forth to their comprehenſions, that they may not be diſmaied by this <hi>Onus Domini,</hi>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60051:68"/>bodies, or their fortunes; for it is not this moral circumciſion, or uncircumciſion, that intitles us to the promiſes, but the ſpirituall ſignature of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the heart; it is not the exterior infliction of miſery, that qualifies us for the reward propoſed, nor a preſent immunity and quiet, that ejects us out of the ſociety of <hi>Chriſts</hi> paſſions; it is the interior diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in both caſes, that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the rightfull title to remunerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In thoſe who are actually exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed under their croſſes, it is the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and pious reſignation which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleth them to the conditions of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi> and in thoſe who are in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuſpenſion, or truce, enjoying a ſerene conveniency, it is the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſpoſure of their hearts, to accept humbly all orders of God, in how ſharp a ſtile ſoever they ſhall be iſſued againſt their perſons, or eſtates. This frame of the mind, is their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before the eyes of God, of their right to the contract of ſuffering mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Chriſt. Job's</hi> diſpoſition in his quotidian ſacrifices, was no worſe an
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60051:68"/>odour to God, then the ſuavity of his patience, fuming up from that meane altar, whereon he lay offering up his aſhes. The materiall part of affliction, doth not ſanctifie, no more then the ſame part in alms, or charity, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate: they are both but <hi>Egena elementa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>Wherefore we may ſay of ſufferings, that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid of a caſe not much unlike to this,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.15</note> 
                  <hi>That no affliction which goeth into a man doth actually ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie him, but it is the ſpirit of ſufferance which reſideth in him, that muſt render him holy,</hi> for out of the heart only good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and humble conformities doe iſſue; ſo as the externall croſſes that fall upon the man, doe not formally purifie him, it is what comes out of the heart, as the emiſſions of humility, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and charity, which his heart ſendeth forth to meete, and imbrace all Gods pleaſures, which can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hallow, and ſanctifie the man. Therefore I may very fitly ſay, if any
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60051:69"/>man hath eares to heare let him heare, that you may not prove ſo unhappy, as to beare the weight, and heat of the day, and to forfeit at laſt your hire, for though God ſaith <hi>He chaſtiſeth every child he receiveth,</hi> he doth not ſay, He receiveth every one that he chaſtiſeth.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>James</hi> therefore when he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to his diſtreſſed country-men, The eſteeming it all joy, their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into various trialls and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, coupleth this reaſon with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>James</hi> 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Knowing that the probation of your faith worketh patience.</hi> So that the benefit muſt be derived from the effect of tribulation, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of patience, the which doth not naturally ſpring out of miſery, for this is but the matter, or the ſubject whereon this virtue is exerciſed, not the ſpirit, or forme of this holy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. For which reaſon the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> compleateth his adviſe, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to direct them, how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe this neceſſary adjunction to the matter of their afflictions, to render
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60051:69"/>them ſubjects of joy, ſaying, <hi>If any of you want wiſdome, let him aske it of God, who giveth it to all men abundantly.</hi> So as this joy, is a ſpirit extracted out of patience, not inherent in the matter of paſſion; and patience is a virtue too celeſtiall to be educed as it were <hi>ex traduce,</hi> by the materiall body of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. It is infuſed by the <hi>holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> confirmeth, when he ſaith,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</note> that <hi>Tribulation worketh pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> ſhewing the reaſon of this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the next words, after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of many good productions, derived from one another, he ſetteth this for the effective cauſe of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>The charity of God is powred forth in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5.</note> So as it is the ſpirit of God, moving upon theſe Waters, which divideth the light from the darkneſſe, not the <hi>Chaos</hi> it ſelfe, that actively produceth theſe two lights of <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the troubles and confuſions of this world, may be the elements, out of which the ſpirit may extract them. For ſufferings ſeeme to be to patience,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60051:70"/>that, which matter, is to the artificer; for though the art be ſeated in the minde, yet it cannot be actuated, and expres'd, but by ſome matter that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it; ſo patience, though it be a ſpirituall diſpoſition inherent in the ſoule, cannot be exerciſed but upon ſome paſſion, and contrariety, which is the ſubject that renders it viſible, and diſcernable; for the Theory of this virtue can no more aſſure us of our abilities in it, then the ſtudie of all the Geometricall rules of Sculpture, can aſcertain a Statuary of his ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, untill he hath experimented it upon either ſtone and braſſe, or waxe, or clay at leaſt; ſome matter is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, to reflect to him the ſight of his notions formed and reduced to their laſt terme, which is a viſible exhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them. So there muſt be ſome afflictions, though not the ſevereſt, yet ſome at leaſt of a ſofter quality, which muſt miniſter ſome matter of contrariety and vexation, to be as the ground, and ſubject, expoſing to our ſelves the worke of our patience upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:60051:70"/>Wherefore as joy in tribulations muſt be derived from Patience, ſo this vertue muſt be acquired by Prayer. They who look lower then God for patience, doe commonly look alſo lower then heaven for the order of their afflictions, and ſo fall ſhort both in the knowledge of the nature of their evils, and their remedies. For they who rely on nature, or morall reaſon for their cure, may well be judged to impute their malady to Fortune; Whereupon S. <hi>James</hi> giveth this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adviſe, to that of our petitioning, and poſtulating of wiſdome,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>James</hi> 6.</note> that <hi>We muſt aske in faith, without any doubting or haeſitation;</hi> not toſſing in an irreſolution of referring our croſſes to the eye of Providence, or to the blindneſſe of Fortune. Such a wavering aeſtuation of ſpirit the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to receive any thing. Our prayer therefore muſt be as fixed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of Gods ſpeciall providence in all contingencies, as it is in the confeſſion of a God, for the one involveth the other; and then we ſhall finde ſuch a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60051:71"/>joy in patience, as our reaſon it ſelfe ſhal witneſſe to be divine, as being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond her reach ſo much, as ſhe muſt avow it to be <hi>Digitus Dei.</hi> Wherefore I beſeech you to beware of the fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of theſe times, betweene the ſtrength of morall reaſon, and the reſt of faith; for there is nothing ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to reaſon, as under the pretence of exalting it, to raiſe it out of the owne ſphere of activity, exacting ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Reaſon, as are not to be found lower then the orbe of grace. For they who aſſigne themſelves peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in all tribulations, out of the ſtock of <hi>Phyloſophie,</hi> prejudice Reaſon much by their over-promiſing for it. For Morall <hi>Phyloſophie</hi> at the higheſt, is but as it were a <hi>Meteor</hi> ſuſpended in the ayre, betweene the earth of a meere ſenſuall,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.

               <p>Methinks many of the Heathen <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi> ſuppoſed in their preſcripts concerning the minds inſenſibleneſſe in all the paſſions, and preſſures of the body, that the body had but ſuch a coexiſtence of place with the mind, as we ſay thoſe bodies of aire have with the <hi>Angels</hi> that aſſume them, in which thoſe ſpirits are onely as movers in a moveable ſubject, not at all united, or affected, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> matter appeareth about them, which is not informed by them, but aſſumed by them, to expoſe them to our ſight, and ſo is only moved by them without any connexion to them. So ſure their ſuppoſitions, that the minde may remaine uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in all the ſufferances and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60051:72"/>of the fleſh, require that our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould be but ſuch ayery matter, rather moved only, then informed by our ſoules. For that apathie, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> propoſe in all the bodies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, cannot hold in that connexion our ſoules and bodies have with one another; and ſo whoſoever ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye upon their concluſions, ſhall finde their conceits ayery and vacuous, and their owne bodies too ſolid, and too cloſely conjoyned to their ſouls, not to be affected with the burthens and preſſures of it. Wherefore our faith teacheth us, to reſort to a higher Principle reſiding in our ſoule, and yet is no part of it, which is the <hi>Holy ſpirit</hi> of God, infuſed by his grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are inſtructed in the incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and deficiencies of our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the detection of our minds inability, in her own ſingle power, proveth her enforcement, nay inable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to reſent all the bodies grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; yet to bear them without diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or reluctancy; and this diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that obnoxious ſtate the ſoule
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60051:72"/>is expoſed unto, ſhoweth her, That as ſhe can doe nothing of her ſelfe but ſuffer, and complain, ſo in virtue of that ſupplementall aid, ſhe can rejoyce in tribulations, and profeſſe,

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the dignity and uſe of</hi> Patience.</head>
               <p>YOu having been preſented in the precedent Chapter, with this expedient of <hi>Prayer,</hi> as the ſpirituall arme which muſt reach down <hi>Patience</hi> to you, I beleeve it may be now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducent to the calming and ſedations of your ſpirits, to expoſe unto you a little the beauty, and dignity of <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which is the only pleaſing figure theſe times can ſet before you.</p>
               <p>The paternall care and tenderneſſe of God hath provided for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our feeble and fainting nature an admirable medicament, which is <hi>Patience;</hi> in order whereunto, he diſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by intervals ſeverall egregious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments and patterns of men, which (like knots upon a weake reede that confirme and ſtrengthen it) might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and fortifiye the fraile ſubſtance
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60051:75"/>of humane nature by example; untill even the image of the inviſible God,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.</note> and the firſt-born of all creatures, nay the <hi>Creator</hi> himſelfe of all things, was to come in the fullneſſe of time, to take this reede of our humanitie into his hand, and to make of it a ſcepter of <hi>Patience,</hi> with which he would exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his dominion over paſſion, and death it ſelfe. In the meane time, leſt the world ſhould want ſome marks to guide it ſelfe by, in miſery, he ſent before him divers precurſors of his <hi>Patience;</hi> and his firſt <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> was ſet out in the very morning of the world; this was <hi>Abel,</hi> who hath left to innocence the right and inheritance of ſuffering, and of <hi>patience: Adam</hi> was the Founder of <hi>Paſsion,</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> the remedy is exhibited ſo neere to the miſchiefe; ſufferings were the inventions of ſinne, and the ſalve of them the preſcript of innocence; for which cauſe, as their owne peculiar right and propriety, <hi>Patience</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dearer to them, but more abundant in the innocent, then in any other. And
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60051:75"/>the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> hath ſtaid longer upon the finiſhed copy of another picture of <hi>Patience,</hi> then upon any one ſubject in all the draughts of his <hi>pencil;</hi> for <hi>Job</hi> hath more time allowed upon him, then any one image of this holy hand, before the <hi>Originall</hi> of all patience ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits himſelfe; whoſe becomming paſſible, is ſo much above our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, as it leaveth no wonder in his <hi>patience;</hi> and his vouchſafing to ſuffer, maketh, in ſome reſpect, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience now rather a prodigious thing, then a naturall, in his members. For if we conſider our ſelves participants of the divine nature, it may ſeeme ſtrange the humane ſhould be predominant in us. For which reaſon, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſeemeth to ſuppoſe he had imparted this power and dominion to the divine portion in us; for when he had left his deareſt members upon earth, with a ſentence of all manner of ſufferings upon them, he telleth them nevertheleſſe, that <hi>He leaves them his peace.</hi> Indeed it is far different, as he ſaith, from that the world giveth; for his peace is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60051:76"/>come the world by patience: and ſo the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> in whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed as much as himſelfe, when he removed from his diſtreſſed friends, ſhewed the vertue of his Commiſſion of <hi>Comforter,</hi> in nothing ſo eminently, as in <hi>Patience,</hi> which he conferred upon Sufferers. Surely even the power of working Miracles, ſeemed not ſo great a gift, as this faculty of <hi>Patience;</hi> for the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> found leſſe controverſie in the vertue of their divine manner of ſuffering, then they did in the prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of their actions: theſe were often imputed to the power of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, but the aſtoniſhing part of their meekneſſe, equanimity, and patience, the devill himſelfe knew not how to calumniate; his pride would not allow him to own ſuch expreſſions of power; and ſo that temper of paſſiveneſſe was accepted as divine, often, when the thunder and lightning of the other ſide of their Commiſſion, paſſed for diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Patience</hi> then ſeemeth a property, which God doth not allow the devill
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60051:76"/>ſo much as to counterfeit the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of; He is permitted to transfigure himſelf into an <hi>Angel</hi> of light, rather then into the forme of a reſigned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented ſufferer, as being an unalienable prerogative of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the moſt dangerous deluſion, whereby he could worke upon the ſpirits of men; and therefore this is the ſpeciall difference between the ſuggeſtions of good and evill ſpirits to us, when they come both clothed in pious ſuperveſtures, that the hand of the proud ſpirit leaves alwaies ſome elation, diſquiet, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience in us to vent and divulge the virtues and graces he ſeemeth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe; but the ſincere inſpiration of the <hi>holy ſpirit,</hi> alwaies calmeth, and ſtilleth any emotion or impatience in the poſſeſſion of his graces, and leaves no heat or glowing in our hearts, that ſolliciteth us to evaporate that ſpirit of joy and peace by which they are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced, but humbly and patiently to encloſe them within the humility of our own breaſts. And thus true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> by the virtue of their <hi>Comforter,</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:60051:77"/>cording to <hi>Chriſts</hi> advice, poſſeſſe their ſoules in patience, which giveth them ſo inviolable a poſſeſſion of their mindes, as the devill can neither diſtraine them by the power of his miniſters injuries, nor diſtract them by the paintings of his owne artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Wherefore God doth puniſh the devill, by allowing him the exerciſing of the patience of his Saints, as S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> ſaith, <hi>Holy Job was more Sathans tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer, then Sathan was the others tempter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for <hi>Jobs</hi> felicity was not repealed by God, but only tranſlated out of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity into adverſity, which is the mother-tongue of the <hi>Saints. Patience</hi> is ſo unintelligible even to the devils ſubtilty, as if he could conceive it, he might quench his flames with it, but God in puniſhment of his firſt ſtrange impatience, in not reſting quieted with his condition, hath made eternall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience the fuell of his tortures; and on the contrary, <hi>Patience</hi> which induceth an equality in the <hi>Saints,</hi> in all their various vexations of this life,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60051:77"/>is a kinde of image of the ſtate of their beatitude, while in all their externall commotions, they retaine a ſmooth, and even compoſure of mind, which is a kind of image of eternity, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the ſame; and in relation to this, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtates the higheſt virtue of the glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in this,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.2.</note> of <hi>remaining in all patience, and longanimity with joy;</hi> ſo as that work, which all the voluptuary arts are long about, and after much labour make but a little joy, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looſeth it again, <hi>patience</hi> finiſheth in a moment, and converteth all into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and ſatisfaction, and treaſureth it up as an eternal proviſion: nay <hi>patience</hi> is ſo powerfull, as it can turne into pleaſure, all thoſe occurrences which ſenſuality muſt run away from, to ſave her petty joyes. All ſorts of injuries of fortune, or of time, are preſently tranſlated by this vertue into nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and delectation; for <hi>patience,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, hath God anſwerable for all ſhe layes up in his hand; if ſhe depoſite an injury in his hand, he is her revenger; if a loſſe, he is her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſer;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60051:78"/>if a ſickneſs, he is her medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciner; if death, he is her reviver. What a freedome doth God allow <hi>Patience,</hi> to make him her debtor of all ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to his truſt? And thus we ſee, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we can finde ſomewhat that God cannot convert into joy, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that doth not return that profit to <hi>Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> commended <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> highly, becauſe they accounted ſuffering, an evill, which that did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage and mitigate; but a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> may in regard that it is good for him to ſuffer, eſteem <hi>Patience</hi> as the beſt of his virtues, becauſe it keeps him the longeſt in that which is ſo good for him. <hi>Fortitude,</hi> or active courage, runs through difficulties with all the haſte it can; <hi>Patience</hi> goes on leiſurely, and enjoyes the good of ſuffering, and on it begets mortification, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which are the legitimate iſſue of a regenerate man; and by this conſtant aſſuefaction &amp; inurement to ſufferings, ſome become by degrees (as it were) impaſſible, and lovers of trialls, for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60051:78"/>as fire doth no longer burn aſhes, the which receiving no hurt from it, doe ſeeme to love the fire, and to cheriſh and conſerve it, ſo one that is conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in <hi>Patience,</hi> comes often to a ſtate of being no more diminiſhed by afflictions, then aſhes are by fire, and to deſire rather to keepe alive the fire of his tribulations, then to exſtinguiſh it; for perfect <hi>Patience</hi> doth not decline ſuffering, but ſuppreſſes immoderate ſorrow, which is the beſt office, for it is ſo provident, as not to deduct at all from the matter of our meriting, but only to mitigate the moleſting part of our affliction; and thus contriveth our advantages ſo well, as we may enjoy the deſerving portion of our troubles, and not be deſolated or oppreſſed by the ſorrowfull property of them.</p>
               <p>We ſee alſo <hi>Chriſts</hi> method, in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them who were to convert the world through all ſorts of tortures, that their <hi>Patience</hi> might be a merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious miracle, which was a better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, then their powers of ſpeaking all tongues, caſting out of devills, or
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60051:79"/>curing all diſeaſes. Their patience in their own wounds, was a more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous grace, then their gifts of cures upon all maladies, for by that they improved their own ſoules, and by this, they did but repaire the bodies of others; they were but organs to paſſe theſe miracles into the world, but they were owners of the other divine quality. And the reſidence of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in them, may be ſaid to be expreſs'd by their <hi>Patience;</hi> and by their other miracles, only a tranſition of him through them. Whereupon S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, that <hi>to ſuffer patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a greater gift then to raiſe the dead;</hi> for indeed we are but debtors to God for this, and we have <hi>Chriſt</hi> our debtor for the other; and it may be, there will be as many pearles even in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, hanging upon the crownes of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> depending on their <hi>Patience,</hi> as on their powers. S. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> (one of the greateſt lights of the primitive times) confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that the ſtupendious equality and conſtancy of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in all their
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60051:79"/>preſſures, convinced him of a divine inſpiration thereof; and Antiquity teſtifies infinite numbers of converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon the ſame perſwaſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chriſt</hi> dignified <hi>Patience,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it ſo meritorious, the <hi>Heathens</hi> were ſo diſpoſed to honour it, by the light of nature, as this tranſcendency of it in <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> eaſily prevayled with them, to ſeeke an author of it, even above all that they had before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for their gods, of whom they had no records, but of their delights, and volupties.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> extoll <hi>Patience</hi> ſo much, as they ſet it even above Fate, to which they ſubjected their gods. One of them ſaith very elegantly, <hi>O admirable power of patience! Other vertues doe in ſome meaſure ſeeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend againſt Fate, Patience onely ſeemes to expugnat it; for thoſe things which Fate hath decreed immutable, and neceſſary, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in ſome manner changeth, turning what was neceſſary, into the being volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and as he that doth ill, perverteth his owne goods into evills, ſo he who ſuffereth
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60051:80"/>evils, well, converteth them into goods, becauſe by a vertuous tolerating of evils, he himſelfe becomes good.</hi> What ſhall <hi>Chriſtians</hi> then ſay in honour of <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> when the true author of Fate, (to whom nothing could be a neceſſity) was pleaſed to ſubject himſelfe to a neceſſity of <hi>patience?</hi> For his humane ſtate may be ſaid to oblige him to it, as it is inſeparable from ſufferings; and he choſe even the moſt paſſive inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to that nature, as poverty, paine, and ignominy, and by all theſe onera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deſigned the exalting of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Patience.</hi> Wherefore as the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> ſaid, it was a ſpectacle worthy of God, a patient man wreſtling with Fortune, we may ſay much more, that it is a declaration of our partaking of the divine nature, our patient ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the injuries of Fortune, ſince in nothing we exhibit a cleerer teſtimony of <hi>Chriſts</hi> communication of this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to us, then in this of ſuffering in a temper of <hi>patience</hi> above our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>And it is not onely the excellency of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60051:80"/>this vertue, which recommendeth it to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but the neceſſity of it, for the ſubſiſtence of all other virtues, for <hi>Patience</hi> doth that office to all the other, as moyſture doth to the earth, which compacteth and conſolidateth the parts thereof, which otherwiſe would moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away, and be inconſiſtent; and ſo all good diſpoſitions of the mind, muſt needs ſcatter and diſſipate quickly, if they were not united and combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by <hi>patience;</hi> the wind of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that bloweth ſo continually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, muſt needs diſperſe them, if they had not this compreſſion of <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> to hold them faſtned together. For which cauſe, S. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in this caſe of their probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Patience is neceſſary for you,

               <p>NOw I have ſet up to you, <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> as a kind of brazen ſerpent, to cure all the ſtingings you are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto, I muſt deſire you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand cleerly the integrall conſtitution of this virtue; for I aſcribe ſo much efficacie to it, ſuppoſing the <hi>Patience</hi> I handle, to be an habit, or diſpoſition in herent in our wills, which receiveth humbly, and beareth uncomplaining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all ſorts of temporall grievances and paſſions, in order to a conformity to the will of God, and our ſimilitude to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> or as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>True Patience ordaineth us to indure all kinds of evills of paine, to avoid all manner of ills of guilt.</hi> Theſe definitions doe not admit either a lame, or a pyde <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> to enter into this high forme of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60051:82"/>efficacie, that is, if it be peccant, either in progreſſe and continuation, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in the integrity that is required in it, of ſubmitting to all ſorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſufferances, as comming all from one providence. If we have any exception againſt any of this Jury of Gods chooſing to try us by, it is a ſign our patience is but ſpotted, and party-coloured; or if it be intermitting, and by fits onely, this betrayeth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſſe of it. Wherefore we muſt endeavour to reertifie our nature in theſe two deficiencies, to which it is very lyable. The firſt is, of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory intervals, in which we let in impatience, and murmur, to detract at leaſt from the intireneſſe of this vertue, and ſuffer our ſenſes to ſpeak too freely againſt that which offendeth them. The other is, of our aptneſſe to make motions to God, for ſome ſpeciall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in our tribulations, reſigning our ſelves but partially to his deſigne upon us; and likely this deprecation is of the preſent croſſe that is upon us, beleeving we could place any other to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60051:82"/>ſit lighter upon us, if that were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, with which we are actually char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and thus we are commonly temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, inſtead of ſuing for <hi>patience</hi> to God, to deſire his <hi>patience</hi> in our repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies, and that he would change his minde rather then ours. This is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar irregularity in our natures, in the point of our ſins, as well as of our ſufferings; there are but few, but would relinquiſh all other, upon condition to have ſome one boſome ſin diſpenced with; and ſo in our afflictions, there are very few, that have not ſome boſome ſorrow, that they would compound for the being exempted from, and offer a reſignation to all the reſt. But this is that he ſitation, or ſtammering, as I may ſay, in out patience, which is a great impediment in our converſation with God.</p>
               <p>I doe not cenſure the firſt motions, or the propenſions of our nature to ſuch eaſes and diſcharges for ſuch a fault as ſhould diſtract or ſcandalize any body with their owne imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this kinde; for as S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith,

                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.3. In many things we offend all; if any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not, in word, this is a perfect man.</note> ſi quis in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo non offendit, hic perfectus eſt.</hi> Theſe inclinations to eaſe, are (as we may ſay) <hi>lapſus linguae, non mentis,</hi> but ſuch trips and faltrings as are hardly fully to be redreſſed: therefore this animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, is intended onely for adviſe, to every one that finds theſe knots and ſtonds in their patience, to endeavour to work them out faithfully by Prayer, and not to ſtop, or hang willingly upon them. But the interruption or diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of our patience, and breaking out into fits of intemperate complaints, is much more to be precautioned and marked for reformation. For according to S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> ſimilitude, this is not onely to ſtrike out of tune, but even to break the inſtrument. For he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>Patience</hi> to a Lute, and tribulations to the ſtrings, which while they are well touched, make muſique; and ſo whilſt <hi>patience</hi> praiſeth God, and gives thanks in tribulations, it yeeldeth a ſweet melody to the eares of God; but when we fall into querulouſneſſe, and murmur, we break the Lute. When
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60051:83"/>therefore we are ſo far advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards victory, as the having our ſenſes diſarmed by affliction, (the pleaſures of which are our enemies ſharpeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments) we muſt watch, that hee forge not new armes out of our pains, which God hath given us as armour againſt his ſhafts; and when he hath ſcarce any art left to wound us by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, through the hardneſſe of our conditions, then he tempteth us by the weight of our armour, to bring us to throw it off by impatience and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: which indeed is to caſt off the defenſive armour, that God giveth the Spirit againſt the devill and the fleſh. When the tempter hath nothing left but paine whereby to provoke us unto offences, one would think he were not to be feared, ſince all impatience is but a new paine, which is propoſed to us, let us therefore conſider that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, when we are ſolicited to unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe and reluctation.</p>
               <p>When we ſuffer by the violence and injuſtice of our enemyes, the Devill would get nothing by this negotiation,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60051:84"/>if we ſhould beare it patiently, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, for hee would loſe as much on the one ſide, as hee had got on the other. What he had gained upon thoſe he had made his officers, and emiſſaries of iniquity and injuſtice, he would loſe as much by the ſufferers improvement and ſanctification, and ſo his malice would be unprofitable unto him; therefore when he hath prevailed with the one part, to act his ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the innocent, then he turneth to the other paſſive ſide, and labours to excite there, murmur, fury, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, that his trade may render him profit on both ſides, a great prize by the malice he imports into the hearts of his factors, and may have ſome gaine alſo exported to him, out of the minds of the patients. Wee know when <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> had ſet the <hi>Sabaeans,</hi> and the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans</hi> aworke againſt <hi>Job,</hi> he left no art uneſſayed to infuſe the fire of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur and impatience into his breſt, and he took the ſubtileſt way; for he got fully into that half of him, that lay in his boſom; and though he did not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60051:84"/>kindle any ſparke of rebellion in his own holy breſt, yet we may ſay his heart was a little overheated in the ardors of that fiery furnace he lay ſo long in, for his breath ſavoreth a little of ſome diſtemper which he found in it. By which we are not warranted to let our tongues looſe, when they preſſe, and ſtraine to break from us, to run after ſome provocation to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, and complaint, but rather war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be exactly vigilant in all ſuch motions, ſince he, whom God choſe for his <hi>Champion,</hi> as having not his like upon the earth, had ſuch words ſhaken out of him in his ſtorm, as we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve he reſented more their having eſcaped him, then he did all the violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he had ſuffered from his adverſary, for he never wiſhed any thing recalled but his words.

This is a celeſtiall manner of negotiating, the demanding of him to whom the <hi>Indenture</hi> is made, the meanes of diſcharging it; but this is the method of God, and worthy of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60051:90"/>himſelfe, to require nothing of his creatures, but what they may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with firſt from him, for but ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.

Which eaſily appeares, in the teſting and tryall of all thoſe flecting fruitions which our cupidities purſue, as riches, honours, pleaſures, and the like, the duration whereof is likely the leſſe, the more the deſire proves ſolicitous thereof. The prejudging of our ſenſes, induceth this ſo unſafe opinion, for their ruling and injuring of us is coetaneous with us, and our reaſon is not of the ſame age, which is the cauſe, why our ſenſes anticipate the apprehenſion of good and evill; inſomuch as our reaſon being much later called in to adviſe us, can hardly confute this preoccupation, even by a demonſtration of the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſſe of ſuch received fallaeies.

                  <hi>Rarò invenitur in terrâ ſuavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter viventium.</hi> Wherefore holy Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> upon the rich mans being caſt into flames, and the reaſon being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, that he had received good things in this life, infers from thence, That the bleſſing of ſuffering muſt be greater in this world, then that of frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60051:93"/>and argueth it thus, That the Divine judgement did not caſt Man out of the garden of pleaſure, to allow him by humane invention to contrive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paradiſe for himſelfe, out of the earth, but left him with a ſentence of being borne to labour; and ſo if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline travaile and pains, as he avoideth what he was borne to in this world, ſo he ſhall be excluded from what he was deſigned to in the next. In which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>A man who paſſeth careleſly on, crowned with roſes through this life, is like a Priſoner carryed through pleaſant fields, and delightfull gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, who being amuſed with the agreeable objects in his paſſage, forgets what he is, and whither he is going.</hi> So dangerous a conveyance is worldly felicity, as the Devill dares truſt that, even alone, without any provocation, but even plenty it ſelfe to bring us to him. For the adherence to the commodities of the earth, quickly raiſeth ſuch a damp and indevotion in our ſpi its, as there needs no crying ſins to mend our pace. This very ſtilneſſe, ſtupefaction, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60051:94"/>ſpirituaſi Lethargie which we ſleepe our ſelves into, in the love of this world, is one of the ſafeſt wayes the Devill can wiſh us into. Wee may therefore fitly ſay of the ſtate of many mens proſperities, that which S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaid elegantly upon the cleerneſſe of the skye in a great drouth producing a famine, that <hi>It was a ſad ſerenity, in which the very faireneſſe and purity was a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> So the ſmoothe, and undiſturbed felicity of many fortunes, proveth an unhappy calme, occaſioning a great ſterility in all ſpirituall productions. Our love to <hi>Chriſt</hi> thrives beſt, in ſuch a mould as his to us was planted in; which we know was an abundance of all ſorts of paſſions; and ſuch a ſoile is ſo much more proper for our faith and charity to proſper in, as the ſame temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which maſter us in felicity, are defeated by us in adverſity; as S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> noteth in <hi>Jobs</hi> tryall, ſaying, that <hi>Man who was overthrowne in Paradiſe, overcame upon a dunghill; there the Serpent overcame him by a woman, here he vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both the Serpent and the woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:60051:94"/>So as we may ſay, That ſufferings ſeeme to render even our decayed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſtronger then felicity could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our intire. For <hi>Adam</hi> was ruined by the ſame attaques, which <hi>Job</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed. Scarce any thing can endeare the vertue of affliction, or raiſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiouſneſſe of proſperity above this inſtance. And ſurely, although there were not ſo much facilitation towards our being perverted in temporall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, yet me-thinks this defect which is ſo notorious in it, ſhould diſcredit the affectation thereof; for it is evident, that we cannot have ſo good a tryall of our loves to God, whilſt we are under his ſenſible careſſes, as under his ſevere corrections. We ſee Satan had ſo much colour for that argument, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity there can be no tryall whether a man love God or no, as he preſſeth it even to God himſelfe in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, asking, <hi>Doth Job feare God for nought?</hi> alleadging that Gods benefits did not admit of a totall proba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion of that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom God himſelfe commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Therefore he putteth God to the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60051:95"/>tryall and examination of his love, when it hath nothing but pure duty, and no temporall intereſt to feed it; and it ſeemeth God allowed this as a good argument, when he changed his condition into that which was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt for the examination of his love, and might prove an irrefragable evince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſanctity. For a patient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence, and a faithfull praiſing God in affliction, doth not only ſilence even <hi>Sathan</hi> himſelfe in his office of accuſer, but ſetteth us ſo much out of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as to render us his impeachers and accuſers before the throne of God. For there cannot be a higher charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his contumacie in his beatitude, then mans returning praiſes to God in his miſeries.</p>
               <p>You may ſee then that Affliction doth not onely furniſh us with armes defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive againſt our enemie, but alſo mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth offenſive armes in Gods cauſe againſt his Rebell: for nothing woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Lucifer</hi> deeper with this point of his ingratitude, then a <hi>Lazarus</hi> playing the Angel, finging Gods praiſes in all
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60051:95"/>his ſores and provocations. And it ſeemes very equitable, that they who are to poſſeſſe the eſtates of the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Angels, ſhould ſerve God thus here on earth, againſt them whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations are aſſigned to them. And in order to this, we may obſerve, how God hath alwayes imployed his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt followers in this ſervice, to ſhame and confound the Devils firſt impatient pride, by their equanimity and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Spirit in all their preſſures and deſolations, making the praiſes of the ſcourger, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of their wounds. For which cauſe, holy <hi>Iudith,</hi> when ſhe undertaketh to comfort her brethren in a deſperate extremity, ſuggeſteth to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> to repreſent to the people, that their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had alwayes been tempted, to try whether they did ſincerely love God; and biddeth them remember how <hi>Abraham</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>Judith</hi> 8.2. All that have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God through many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note>

               <p>We may remark alſo that among all the <hi>Patriarks</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> who had the honour to be types of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we finde but one exempted out of the liſt of his precurſors in diverſe paſſions, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; and <hi>Solomon</hi> onely paſſing through the ſmooth delicious alleyes of this world, fell ſo dangerouſly, as the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> hath not ſet him up again before us; whereby we may conclude, that God intended the leaving of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> caſe undecided, as a terrible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to us, of the perillous eſtate of proſperity, ſince ſo great an organ of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> is not manifeſtly reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his place, where all the reſt are evidently fixed, following the ſuffering <hi>Lambe,</hi> whom they had the honour to precede, and to prefigure. So as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we may hope well of <hi>Solomon,</hi> we may ſafely condemne continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all proſperity, as a formidable ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, ſince worldly felicity leaveth us in ſuſpenſe of the ſalvation of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60051:96"/>affliction giveth us great hopes of the reconciliation of <hi>Manaſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it may well be obſerved, that the firſt <hi>Angel</hi> which is recorded in ſcripture to have been ſent to the earth, was upon the occaſion of an extreme diſtreſſe;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.12.</note> which was to <hi>Agar</hi> flying in the deſert; and the <hi>Angel</hi> giveth this teſtimony of the reaſon of his miſſion, <hi>Becauſe the Lord had heard the voice of her affliction;</hi> ſo as <hi>Agars</hi> being in miſery, bringeth her to be honoured by the miniſtery of an <hi>Angel,</hi> ſooner then <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi> being miſtreſſe, and in authority; and ſo diſtreſſe had quickly obtained pardon for undutifulneſſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all they who have faults to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, may be glad to have ſufferings for interceſſors, for they ſpeak in vertue of that blood, which calls for better things then that of <hi>Abel;</hi> they mediate reconciliation, and deprecate revenge. And therefore we finde God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſay, <hi>Cum ipſo ſum in tribulatione;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I am with him in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation.</note> and his preſence is often ſo manifeſted in tribulation, as they who had ſcarſe heard of him before, come to know

And for that end, he preferd the furnace, for his Temple to appeare in, before all the ſumptuous edifices of <hi>Babylon.</hi> In like manner, when God reſolved to ſhew himſelfe to <hi>Nabuchodonoſar,</hi> he would not vouchſafe to come into his palaces, but carryed him out into the fields, and laid him as low as the graſſe that fed him, and then in this poſture of being neerer a beaſt then a King, vouchſafed to viſit him, to ſhew him how much more he eſteemed miſery and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then temporall glory and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60051:97"/>And thus we ſee, how man in honour, becomes like the beaſt that periſheth; and man in diſhonour, being reduced even to the likeneſs of a beaſt, recovereth and reſtoreth the image of God in him ſelfe, which his other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had almoſt obliterated.</p>
               <p>Nay affliction is ſo proper to finiſh and perfect Gods image in us, as <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> had that given him for an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſanctity, which he had by order from God, preſcribed <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchodonoſar</hi> for expiation of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. He for having deſtroyed thoſe <hi>Idols,</hi> which the other had adored, was ſent among the beaſts for a reward; the lions den is given as it were for a recompence of his ſervice, againſt both the ſpirituall, and materiall dragon; and devout <hi>Toby</hi> was brought into darkneſſe and the ſhadow of death,

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60051:98"/>him.</hi> So as the tribulation of this world, ſeemes the penny conditioned for in this life, and due as wages to the travail in Gods ſervice. And indeed the weight, and heat of this day, or rather moment of this life, may well be accounted our beſt ſalary in it, ſince the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> telleth us, that <hi>Light and momentary tribulation worketh in us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly above meaſure an eternall weight of glory;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</note> and ſo God who knoweth how the crownes are to be given out by weight, according to that we bring in of croſſes, marked by Gods ſtamp upon them, he may well load us here, in that order, to the elevating of us, by his juſtice, as well as his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>Whereupon all the Saints, the liker they grow to the image of <hi>Chriſt</hi> under Gods hand, diſcern the cleerlyer this deſigne of God, and ſo rejoyce in their tribulations, proportionately to the light they receive, by theſe openings of their owne mudde walls, wherein they are immured; and ſo by Gods making as it were through lights in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60051:98"/>their bodies, the ſoule comes to have the clearer proſpect on all ſides of her, whereby ſhe diſcerneth, that God in this work of breaking down the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of carnall appetites, which are like walls about us, removeth but duſt, and bringeth in light; and therefore we ſee, how the Martyrs rejoyce while theſe windows, as I may ſay, &amp; through lights, were beating out in their bodies; while they were made tranſparent with wounds, the ſoule had the more light given her; and ſo they looked upon their enemies, as ſet awork to break down their priſon, alwaies paying them their prayers for their labour. And we need not look back into ſtory, for ſuch lights as theſe, whereby to read the joy of ſufferings, for I may ſay of theſe examples, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid of his precepts, <hi>They are not beyond the ſea,

               <p>It is well ſaid of one, that wee may wonder that all the ſtones under the feet of the reprobate, doe not turn into roſes, for ſome ſolace to them now, in regard of what they are to ſuffer. And therefore we need not wonder, if all things under the feet of the elect, doe turne into thornes to puniſh them for their ſinnes, ſince their tranſitory paines augment ſo much their eternall bleſſedneſſe.

               <p>Beſides, there is commonly a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all divine authority in Tribulation, wherein the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> breathes himſelf out more efficaciouſly then by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> or by the holy Scriptures: for we often reſiſt the Word of God, and<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60051:101"/>ſlight the admonition of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions though they ſpeake in a ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and more unpleaſant ſtile to us, yet take our eares, and bring us to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer more promptly, <hi>ſpeak Lord, for thy ſervant heareth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the Pſalmiſt expreſſeth thus both the nature of man, and the virtue of tribulation,

For then they ſent to him ſome of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> 12.</note> and of the <hi>Herodians,</hi> who were to work upon his tenderneſſe, and compaſſion of the publick, to enſnare him by his benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60051:103"/>and charity to others; and to that purpoſe they moved him in a point of commiſeration to his Countrey, asking him with a Preface of his praiſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might not eaſe themſelves of the publique tribute? And this they thought a likely way to inſnare his goodneſſe, when all their other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects could not infirme his vertue: In like manner our ſubtileſt enemy may have found many of you anſwering, and correſponding faithfully in all his examinations of you, in your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſorrows, loſſes, and diſtreſſes, and finding you thus armed in your owne perſons with JOB's <hi>Dominus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.21.

And this tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may well be preſented you with praiſes of your owne vertues, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more upon your devotion, as a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60051:103"/>properly affected to the love of your Religion. This is ſo fine, and ſoft an inſinuation of motions to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and diſcordance from Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as you may very eaſily be ſlid into it, upon this ſo ſmoothe, and faire ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion thereof, as a practiſe of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duty. I ſhall therefore endeavour to detect unto you the danger of this ſo ſubtile illaqueation, and inſnare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in this net may be made of your owne pieties. For when <hi>Sathan</hi> ſtands among the ſonnes of God, he is in the moſt dangerous poſition for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, that is, when in the ſhape of ſome vertue he introduceth a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Firſt then we muſt lay this for ground-work of all our peace of ſpirit, a firme immovable perſwaſion of the divine providence in all occurrencies. This rock the devill doth not attempt to batter in the minds of ſober, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, but worketh to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it by arguments, and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. When any thing occurreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruent to our reaſon, concerning
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60051:104"/>the government of ſuch affaires as ſeeme properly to appertaine to Gods intereſt, as the miſcariage, and adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods cauſe and his <hi>Churches</hi> peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitation, in theſe advantages the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent hath over our weak and dim po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of reaſoning, he alwaies inforceth this ſubtilty upon us, <hi>That Gods hand cannot be in matters ſo oppoſite to his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> To which our faith anſwereth eaſily enough, when it is awake; but when our mindes are in that ſtate the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> confeſſeth even his to have been reduced unto,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118 28. My ſoule hath ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd for tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> of <hi>Dormitavit anima mea prae taedio,</hi> when our ſpirits are growne drowſie and heavy under the burthen of their encumbrances, then he preſſeth this point upon us, when the vivacity of our faith is a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. But my feet were almoſt moved, my ſteps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peace of ſinners.</note> and by watching this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity we know the tempter hath ſhaken even the greateſt <hi>Saints,</hi> as we know <hi>David</hi> himſelfe avoweth in <hi>Mei autem penè moti ſunt pedes, penè effuſi ſunt greſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus meì, pacem peccatorum videns.</hi> So as this is a temptation to be precautioned by the beſt adviſes can be provided.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60051:104"/>For what the enemy aimeth at in the firſt place, is not to ſubvert directly our faith, but to ſupplant our peace, and quiet of ſpirit; and when he hath raiſed this miſt in our diſcourſing faculty, then all the images are ſet before us, ſeeme to have farre different proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the realities themſelves.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt ſafe admonitions therefore is to watch upon our prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to paſſion, either in griefe, anger, or enmity; for an intemperance in any of theſe, upon the ſeveral occaſions which reſpect each of them, doth firſt cloud that ſerenity of mind, which ſhould keep the light of Gods providence cleere to our apprehenſion, and then inſenſibly we ſink into chagrins and diſſavours of Gods preſent judgements. Therefore let us alwayes check the firſt motions to any exceſſe of ſorrow, though the occaſion be never ſo legitimate as even for the perſecution of the <hi>Church;</hi> in that caſe, we muſt ſeek to repreſſe any immoderate reſentment of it, though the colour ſeeme ſuch, as admits of no over-doing in it; yet all extremities,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60051:105"/>even of zeale in this exigence, weaken and enfeeble our Reaſon, and ſo leave us worſe armed againſt our opponent, who alwayes ſeeketh to deduce ſome reaſon of repining, and diſreſpect to Gods order, out of this argument of Gods unconcernment in the ſafety of his children. Therefore in all provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to griefe, we muſt attend the preſerving of our ſpirits as little over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt by ſadneſſe as we poſſibly can, for in this obſcurity the enemy ſoweth what we feele growing up before we ſee it caſt into us. For which cauſe, let this be a generall receit for all emergencies in matter of diſconſolation, to oppoſe ſtudiouſly the firſt motions towards any inordinate ſorrow or reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>That I may then give you ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſatisfaction in this caſe of yours, which may ſeeme ſo devout a diſquiet, in order to the <hi>Churches</hi> ſufferings, I muſt deſire you to lay this in your minds as a deep and immoveable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, That the verity of the <hi>Church</hi> is not queſtioned by the viciſſitude of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60051:105"/>ſtates into which ſhe is tranſlated. You may conſider that your faith telleth you, the roots of the <hi>Church</hi> are grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a rock, and are watred, and kept alive by a ſupernaturall irrigation, with the dew of heaven; ſo as no ſtorm can looſen them, nor no heat penetrate ſo far as to offend them. The particular branches of this ſtemme may wither, or be removed according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance of the places they are planted in, as we ſee that many ſingle ſhafts and bodies of particular <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> which are but ſprigs in reſpect of the Univerſall, are now eradicated even in the firſt ground they were planted, as we ſee in the deſolation and barrennes of <hi>Mount Sion</hi> it ſelfe, and the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which we may call the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> where the tree of life firſt ſprang up, and where the <hi>Church</hi> ſeemed to all humane reaſon, rooted ſo deep, as nothing but the diſſolution of the world could evert it, and yet we ſee it ſo extirpated out of that place, as there are only ſome few fruits (of thoſe roots which S. <hi>Peter</hi> left fixed at <hi>Rome</hi>)
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60051:106"/>now viſible in that Country, which are, as we may ſay, gathered in theſe parts, and tranſported thither. For moſt of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion now exerciſed in the holy Land, is but in the ſocieties of ſome few of the <hi>Religious Orders</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which are but as it were granaries of the bread of life, not ſeminaries, or fields, in which there is a naturall proviſion for a ſucceſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> being there are few, or almoſt no ſecular families of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Country. And on the other ſide of the Globe, in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> the <hi>Antipodes</hi> to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> being then the patrimony of the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: thoſe parts which ſate ſo long in darkneſſe, and the ſhadow of death, have now ſeene the great light, and have it ſhining on a candleſtick, while <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelfe ſits mourning in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Theſe are the inextricable folds wherein God wraps up his providence,
<note place="margin">The ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher into majeſtie ſhall be oppreſſed by glory.</note> which they who will attempt to depli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by their reaſon, ſhall find the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>Scrutator majeſtatis opprimetur à gloriâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:60051:106"/>Let this then be our reſt, (to keep us either from ſinking into diffidence of Gods vigilancy over us, or from ſliding into a curious inquiſition into his order of conducting us) the concluding, That God is wiſer, juſter, and more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then we can imagine; and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured of our being incorporated in the true <hi>Church,</hi> we may anſwer all our perplexities concerning it, that God hath obliged himſelfe to conſerve and propagate it; which he muſt needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme better then we can deſigne.

               <p>And this figure of the deliverance of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from their captivity, may afford an appoſite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for your preſent conditions; for though <hi>Catholike</hi> religion ſeeme in <hi>England</hi> now, but a dead carcaſſe, reduced to arifyed and dryed bones, yet when your pious ſolicitudes que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion your reaſon, whether it can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how theſe exſiccated and mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated bones can be revived? your faith muſt anſwer as the <hi>Prophet</hi> did, <hi>Our Lord knoweth;</hi> this reſtauration is as eaſie to him, as impoſſible to us; and though we cannot preſcribe a time, yet we may ſafely perſwade e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to be confident, that in Gods

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60051:109"/>though in ſome reſpects there be much of the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> in them, as they are acts of the hands of brothers, yet in order to the interceding for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and advance of <hi>Catholicke</hi> Religion, their bloud ſpeaks in the ſame voyce of that of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it calls for mercy, not revenge even upon the ſhedders of it. So that when you are ſhaken with an apprehenſion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhment of that little light is left in our nation,

                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:60051:110"/>But I may with probability expect to be asked, whether this calme of ſpirit in all publick calamities, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate vexations, imports ſo dead a ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as ſhall admit of no emotion, or reſentment in the diſtreſſes of the <hi>Church,</hi> the gravations of our friends, and all the preſſures whereunto we our ſelves are ſubjected?</p>
               <p>To this I can readily anſwer, that I doe not propoſe this <hi>Stociall apathy,</hi> or inſenſibleneſſe, in all accidents; for I know the paſſions of ſorrow, and fear, are not only inherencies in our infirm nature, but even injanctions, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of grace in many occaſions. We know <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> wept for his friend; which few drops (ſhowred from heaven, upon the ocean of this ſalt water, with which our earth is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded) were defigned to ſweeten, and ſanctifie thoſe waters, by the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Communion, into ſuch expreſſions of our compatency, and ſimpathy with our brother.

For as they are ſenſible pledges of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with our neighbour in his grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, they give him the readieſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of our loves; and ſo this water above the nature of all other, retaineth and expoſeth the impreſſion, and ſignature of what is impreſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, which is our charity, and ſo our teares are taken by our neighbours as ſeales of our fraternall dilection.</p>
               <p>With good reaſon then in publicke exigencies, and in private occaſions of juſt lamentations, ſuch ſenſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of our conſociation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in the cauſe, are often requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, for the efficacie of our charity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to others. For as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>No body can conſolate a mourner that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60051:111"/>doth not ſhow ſome concerdancy whith his minde;</hi> and our heart muſt be firſt ſoftened, that it may be congruous to the intendred heart of the afflicted, and thus faſten it ſelfe to the neceſſity it is to work upon. Iron is beſt conjoyned to Iron if they be both melted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one fire. The apparence then of this ſimpathy is often manifeſtly neceſſary for the rendering our offices of charity beneficiall. Wherefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth often leave the print of his teares upon his epiſtles, as the beſt ſeales of his cordiall dilection. And thoſe paſſions of greef, and feare which <hi>Chriſt</hi> was pleaſed voluntarily to raiſe in the inferiour part of his mind (which paſſions yet never went higher then his reaſon aimed them) were all inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to conſolate us in our paſſions, to qualifie and mitigate our ſenſe of the infirmity of ours, and to propoſe to us, an endevour of moderating the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatneſſe thereof, that we may accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his councel, aim at a ſimilitude of that holineſſe, to which we cannot project an equality; and his precept im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth no further duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:60051:111"/>And when <hi>Chriſt</hi> confeſſed, that <hi>his ſoule was troubled,</hi>

                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.27</note> he both alloweth and inſtructeth our troubled ſoules, which uſes S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently derive from theſe words, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>Lord you command my ſoule to follow, but I ſee your ſoule troubled.

But I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your miſericordiouſneſſe, O Lord; for you are troubled by the election of your love and charity to conſolate, and ſupport the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, from bending towards deſperation.</hi> To this end our head took upon him the ſenſes and affections of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and as he doth excite us to high aſpirings, he doth ſympathize with us in low imbecilities. So we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he doth, ſpeaking thus unto us, <hi>You have heard the voice of my fortitude calling to you, and you have heard the voice of your owne infirmity ſpeaking in me; I miniſter force that you may run, nor doe I retard or excuſe you from making haſte, but owning your timidity, I levell the path of your aſcenſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence is cleerly collected, that a

Therefore when he had loſt all his ſubſtance, and his children, it is ſaid, he roſe, and tore his garments, ſhavea his head, and falling to the ground he adored.

Therefore he was not moved, leſt he might offend by an exceſſe of reſentment, nor unmoved leſt he might ſeeme to ſlight the corrector by inſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But as there are two precepts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the love of God, and the love of our

               <p>Surely theſe words of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> doe fully regulate your caſe, that you may ſorrow and grieve in order to the expreſſing a ſenſe of your chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and paying the duty of trater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall charity.

                  <hi>A ſorrow according to God, which worketh pennance unto ſalvation:</hi> there is another queſtion, very oovious in theſe conjunctures, which requireth a ſolid reſolution, as, how farre we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to conform our wills to the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wil of God in publike judgements, and in caſes of the prevalence of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and violence over right and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? This caſe is thus regulated in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity; We know the Will is, or ought to be carryed to the object thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what is propoſed by Reaſon; and it hapneth often, that the ſame thing may be diverſly confidered by Reaſon; ſo that which in ſome reſpect is good, in another may be ill; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when our will defireth any thing, as it hath the nature of good, our defire is licite and rectified; and if another
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60051:113"/>deſireth the contrary in the ſame thing, as it hath in his ſenſe the nature of a good, that oppoſite Will is alſo good and approvable. As the will of a Judge is juſt, when he voteth the death of a Malefactor; and the deſire of the wife, or ſon of the condemned, which oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the other, as they apprehend the husbands life under the notion of a good, is alſo lawfull and vertuous. The <hi>Judge</hi> governeth his will by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and the wife by the private of her family, and ſo both their wills are ordered reſpectively to their ſeverall reaſons. Now it is the good of the whole Univerſe, that is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily in the apprehenſion and concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, who is the Maker, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60051:114"/>doe not hold ſo in an univerſal reſpect, and the ſame holdeth convertibly: Whereby it comes to paſſe, that ſome will is good, deſiring a thing in order to a particular good, which God doth not will, becauſe man wiſheth according to the light he hath, and his owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, which cannot extend to the diſcernment how the particular he wiſheth, concordeth, or diſcordeth with the univerſall benefit which he is obliged to prefer, as far as he is infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med onely: So that to conſtitute a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed will, in the deſire of a particular good, the private may be wiſhed mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially, but the common and divine good muſt be intended formally, that is, the thing we deſire, may be affected as the matter of it is a good to us; and the end of our affecting it muſt be as we conceive it good and agreeable to the common order of God upon the world.</p>
               <p>Therefore the wil of man is obliged, to be conformable to that of God, in the thing he wiſheth, in this reſpect, of referring it to the fulfilling of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60051:114"/>deſigne of his <hi>Creatour:</hi> But he is not commanded to annex his will to every particular matter wherein Gods will is declared, becauſe he is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how that ſpecial courſe condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to the common good; ſo as he may wiſh the accompliſhment of Gods purpoſes, by thoſe wayes, notified to his reaſon to be moſt equitable and conſonant to the divine goodneſſe. And becauſe we cannot judge how the ruine of a good cauſe, doth contribute to the common good, we may well diſſent in that particular marter, and yet ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine reſigned to the Univerſall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. In this order many of the <hi>Saints</hi> have deprecated even Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed judgements to them, as <hi>Abraham</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and it is evident, and frequent in all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> when they appeal from Gods ſeverity decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to his mercy which they ſolicited; &amp; ſome ſo vehemently even after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prohibitions, as God is faine to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence them; as <hi>Samuel</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the behalfe of the captived people, and many the like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60051:115"/>inconformities we find in the <hi>Saints.</hi> But this kind of diſcrepancy is better called a Velleity, or wiſhing that Gods order were otherwiſe, then a diſſenting from it: and this incomplete concurrence with the <hi>Divine will,</hi> is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with in this our imperfect light, which we receive but through a dim glaſſe; and till we come to be above all ſenſe of ſorrow, we ſhall never be exempted from a defective perſpection through the cauſes of all calamities in this world; and ſo there is no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity exacted of us, then there is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination imparted. The bleſſed, who ſee many preſent acts, and the ſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Divine providence, in that light which ſhoweth all ſatisfaction at firſt ſight, have their wills as intirely united, as their underſtandings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummately informed; Wherefore if we have a rectifide ſenſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective adherence of our wills to God, even that reſentment may be very ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plymentall to the deficiency of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition.</p>
               <p>It ſeemes cleere therefore that in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60051:115"/>all common calamities, wherein the violations of juſtice are manifeſt, our wills may ſafelyer be, as I have explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, unconformable to Gods will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in thoſe grievances, remaining in a confeſſion of our incapacity, to conceive the reference they have to his glory) then our wills may be concurrent with Gods, moved by the preſumption of our underſtanding, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the concluding it ſelfe rationally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the cauſes of ſuch events. For this adherence is upon a worſe ground, then the other ſuſpenſion, in regard it reſteth upon Reaſon more then upon Faith. So they who are conformed to Gods pleaſures, as they ſuppoſe themſelves informed of the equity of them, may be better ſaid to adhere to their own ſufficiency,

               <p>All theſe premiſſes well weighed, will afford us clearly this concluſion, that in publick adverſities, and private afflictions, our will may ſeem to differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods, in the matter of preſent cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as in the prevailing of injuſtice, or the detriments we ſuffer by our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſo our wills be conjoyned with the divine will, in the reaſon of our deſiring what we doe, that is, when we wiſh that difference, only, as we conceive it more conducent to Gods glory.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60051:118"/>call, you may all think your ſelves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in this <hi>Proclamation</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> as you are qualified with the conditions ſpecified, of being in labour and under burthens; and yet you may eaſily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, what loads you are called to bring firſt to be diſcharged of; your temporall gravations that lye upon you, may goe neere to haſten you too much, in your ſtarting forward into this courſe of reliefe, without looking out, and laying uppermoſt that burthen which muſt be firſt removed, before you can hope for this lightning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneration which is propoſed unto you. And indeed theſe times, without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular prevention by the grace of God, are likely to tempt many, to come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> with their firſt ſuit, as he did in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that came with his firſt motion of complaining on his brothers detention of his inheritance, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Chriſt</hi> to right him in that oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.18.</note> this was the heavieſt burthen whereof he was ſenſible, of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt <hi>ſequeſtration</hi> lying upon him. But we know <hi>Chriſts</hi> anſwer cleereth this caſe
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60051:118"/>to us, that his call doth not ſummon ſuch preſſures to come in for eaſe in the firſt place. The greedy man who had conſtituted <hi>Chriſt</hi> for his temporall Judge, made himſelfe a <hi>Delinquent,</hi> in what he was a Judge of, and found him no Judgel, in what he would have had him one. And ſo ſhall all thoſe, who come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to commence their firſt ſuit about any temporall damages, find this plea caſt out rather then admitted, and their burthens will but grow the heavier, by this earneſtneſſe to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of them; they will be but like weights taken off from their backs, and laid upon their heads, where they will more annoy them.</p>
               <p>It moſt importeth us then to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved, of what burthen we ought firſt to ſeek our diſcharge; for it is one of ſo ſtrange a nature, as the increaſe of the weight diminiſheth alwayes the feeling and ſenſibleneſſe of the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And this inſenſibleneſſe, as it aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth, doth likewiſe aggravate the weight, ſo as there is a great perill, to leave never ſo little of this matter, that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60051:119"/>hideth it ſelfe by the ſame degrees it heightens in us. Theſe qualities are ſo little ſortable to the temporal burthens of croſſes and afflictions, as they cannot be conceived to be the grievances we muſt firſt complain of. Nothing but ſin is to be found counter-marked with theſe notes upon it. That then is the burthen you are firſt adviſed to bring in to be delivered of; this weight which the world commonly laboureth and ſweateth moſt to charge it ſelfe with; and yet it is truly ſo ſtrangely onerous, as even God and Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> did ſweat blood under the weight thereof, although he carryed but the lighter halfe of it, the paine onely, not the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. This is then the firſt oneration, whereof you muſt intend the demiſſion and deliverance. For they who begin with calling to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for alleviation of temporall burthens, or ſolicite him to tranſpoſe their loads upon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſetting theſe articles of eaſe and animoſity before all the reſt in their Petitions, doe (me thinks) as if the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſhould have ſued to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60051:119"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to have given him clothes to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him onely. For when we have the uncleanneſſe of any foule ſinne upon us, to intend any thing, before the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie from that, is but to beg a covering, or palliation of our diſtreſſe. And we know, temporall commodities doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hide and clothe the leproſie of ſin, but ſeldome contribute to the emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and they who lift up their hands in the firſt place, to draw down venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, even from him to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, doe (me thinks) as if the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and wounded <hi>Traveller</hi> in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> ſhould have deſired the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> to have followed the theeves to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, and deliver them to juſtice, before he had thought of dreſſing his owne wound; it is but ſuch a prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous application, to purſue even Gods enemies, while we have our own ſins crying out, and endangering our ſouls, and crying for revenge againſt us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame notion we proſecute our enemies.</p>
               <p>We muſt all then retaine this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the firſt exoneration we muſt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60051:120"/>deſigne, is, to be this of the burthen of our ſinnes; and when we are delivered from them, our croſſes will prove ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our carriages then our burthens; for as death is formidable in this face and aſpect of the wages of ſinne, (and that countenance may juſtly fright us) but when we look upon it as a debt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt pay nature before we can paſſe to eternall life; in this view, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth rather officious, then offenſive to us; in like manner, when our afflictions and croſſes are charged upon us as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our iniquities, ſtill growing in us, as in the caſes of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> then they have an intollerable heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them; but when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered but as fees and duties we muſt pay in our paſſage through this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life, unto a blisfull perpetuity, and that all the <hi>Saints</hi> have paid them in their pilgrimage, then they appear ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerviceable then formidable unto us: So hereupon I may ſay, that when our ſinnes are heaped and accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated on our croſſes, preſſing and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them upon us, then the charge is unſufferably grievous; but when our
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60051:120"/>ſufferings are impoſed and charged upon our ſinnes, and that they preſſe our faults ſo hard upon our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the preſſure of our offences groweth intolerable, and ſo forceth us to come creeping humbly under our loade, to this promiſe of releefe which <hi>Chriſt</hi> exhibiteth to all ſuch labourers, and loaded ſoules, then our affliction proveth an happy ſurcharge, that hath ſunke through our hearts, that other ſad portage of our ſinnes, which before peradventure did not diſeaſe us, and then the heavineſſe of our croſſes which remaineth, will comparatively with the other we are releaſed of, ſeeme ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſie, and portable; as one that ſhould riſe from being bedrid with the <hi>Palſie,</hi> or <hi>Sciatica,</hi> after he were cured, would find a little charge to carry his blankets upon his back. There is ſuch an analogy, between the weight of ſinne and of ſufferance, as between theſe two different heavineſſes; And ſure the <hi>Paralitike,</hi> who went back charged with his bed upon him, found leſſe heavineſſe, then when he was caryed upon his bed. So when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60051:121"/>that we finde hath partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to our ſpirituall riſing, and recovering out of our bed-rid habits of ſinne, remaineth upon us, we carry it ſo lightly, as we handle it rather as a benefit then a burthen. Then we find ſenſibly, the verity of this aſſertion, of <hi>Jugum meum ſuave eſt,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.30 My yoke is ſweet and my burthen light. <hi>Jere.</hi> 48.11.</note> &amp; onus meum leve.</hi> When we have found reſt for our ſoules, all other agitations are but (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith) powring us out from veſſell into veſſell, to purge us of our dregs, and faeces which we ſhould ſettle in againe it may be, if we were let ſtand.</p>
               <p>And to evidence this principle that we muſt firſt begin our addreſſes to God with the <hi>Prodigals Pater peccavi,</hi> before we ſue for caſting off our rags, and being apparelled with convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, we may conſider, how God doth not account himſelfe ſo much as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to by us even in all our clamours, untill,
<note place="margin">Jerem. Thren.</note> as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith, the cloud be removed that intercepted our prayer from paſſing. For <hi>David</hi> affirmeth this experience, ſaying, <hi>Becauſe I held my
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60051:121"/>peace my bones are as it were waxen old, while I cryed all the day.</hi> So as you ſee, all <hi>Davids</hi> clamours are but as dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the eares of God, ſo long as his ſinne ſleepeth within his breſt, though his throat grow hoarſe, he doth but as it were ſtrain to cry out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water, while his iniquity like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are gone over his head. Hereby, we ſee, that all vociferation while our ſinnes are quiet and tacent in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, is no more audible, then ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and on the contrary we may note that God accounted <hi>Moſes</hi> to have made a loud exclamation, when we finde he was ſilent; his heart being not obſtructed with ſinne, uttered a voice which penetrated the heavens while his tongue had no part in the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60051:122"/>upon that key of confeſſion of his fin, in this note of <hi>I have made my ſin known unto thee, and mine iniquity I have not hid,</hi> then every whiſper of his to God is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, for we finde him profeſſing this alſo,

                     </expan> die invocavero te, ecce cognovi quia Deus meus es.</hi> So as here we ſee the divers effects of Prayer, while our ſins cry the louder for our ſilencing them, no other vociferation is made but theirs, which we do not utter; &amp; when they have firſt lifted up their voice, through the organ of our voluntary proclamation of them, and a ſorrowful invocation of mercy, then every brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſmalleſt inſpiration of our ſouls in prayer, is a tone loud enough to reach heaven. Then as <hi>David</hi> avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, we ſhall find him our God at all houres we ſeek him, and diſcern the reaſons, why we are then heard, and why we were not before regarded; which are theſe two <hi>David</hi> giveth us, of the firſt he ſaith, <hi>If I have beheld ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in my heart, our Lord will not heare;</hi> and of this other, in caſe of having purged this impurity by our penitence,

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon we may obſerve, that the <hi>Prophets</hi> in all publique calamities, did exhort the people in the firſt place to purifie their hearts and their hands, by a diſcharge of their ſinnes, before they preſumed to lift them up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for receits of temporall degravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60051:126"/>aſſertion of the <hi>Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.</note> The ſorrow that is according to God, worketh pennance unto ſalvation, that is ſtable.</hi> Upon which words S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>ſorrow is given us not to grieve for any thing we cannot remedy,</hi> and ſo it is onely a receipt for the cure of ſinne, for it augmenteth all other evills whereunto it is applyed, and recovereth us onely out of that extremeſt of all miſchiefs. Therefore ſorrow was onely made for ſinne, out of which it was firſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and ſo like a moath corrodeth and conſumeth the matter that produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it. And this holy corroſive, is ſo powerfull, as it will eat away not onely all the dead fleſh whereunto it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but even take out, and obliterate the fouleſt brands can have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon our hearts.</p>
               <p>Therefore if any for feare of a little burning in the hand, in the heat of theſe times, hath choſen rather to ſtigmatize his heart with the marke of <hi>apoſtaſie,</hi> let not even ſuch a deſperat character, doubt of an effaceing by the virtue of ſincere contrition, for as ſoone as it is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60051:127"/>rightly applyed, the operation is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable. Let not then any ſuch, ſet <hi>Caines</hi> ſtamp upon this his firſt brand, for could <hi>Judas</hi> have applyed this corroſive, he needed not have uſed his cord to ſuppreſſe the noyſome ſtenches of his conſcience. This receipt would have broken his heart ſo happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to have kept his bowells from burſting; for we know that a broken and contrite heart, repayres even all her owne breaches. If in theſe evill dayes then, there ſhould be any that hath done worſe then the diſciple, that left his mantle, and fled naked to ſave himſelfe, for if any to ſave their clothes, and coverings of convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes, ſhould have left <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and have joyned with the party armed againſt him, yet even he is called by this voice of <hi>Come all ye that labour,</hi> to come back, and unload himſelfe of this unfaithfull puſillanimity. No weight that ſorrow can bring in, can be too much for him to take off who carieth all things by the power of his word, and whoſe mercy is above all his works, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60051:127"/>muſt needs be far above all ours. Wherefore Deſpaire ſeems mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably to vie againſt the ſuperiority of Gods mercy; in this accurſed dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is this derogating contention, whereas faithfull ſorrow hath alwayes an obliging confidence. He therefore that cannot find in his heart to give ſo much as ſorrow towards the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſinnes, ought not to expect ſo much as pitty even in their eternall vindication.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in this particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of <hi>Conſolation,</hi> I may aptly ſay with the <hi>Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> Who is it can make me glad, but he that is made ſorry by me?</hi> For the efficacy of all I can miniſter unto you, dependeth upon your orderly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this godly ſorrow for your ſinnes, which may reconcile you to the <hi>man of ſorrow,</hi> who under that notion, was the <hi>mediator</hi> between God offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and man condemned, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth not even his owne merits to mediate peace between God, and man, after his offending him, without the intervention of this ſorrow of man;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60051:128"/>ſo that this houſe is as much better then that of feaſting, as reparation of a houſe is better then ruining, in ſo much, that though you have no other houſe left to put your heads in, this of penitence (which it may be the ruines of your other have built up for you) may prove ſuch a receptacle of peace, and reſt, (when your ſinnes are raſed, and demoliſhed) as you ſhall confeſſe in comparing the change of houſes, that <hi>Your bricks are fallen down,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.10.</note> and you have built with ſquare ſtones,</hi> and have by the hands of this holy contrition, converted your ruinous tenement into reedified temples, from whence all the devout fighes, are breathed up as an odour of perfume unto heaven; and as the <hi>fire</hi> which was to light the odours upon the table of <hi>Incenſe,</hi> was to be brought from the <hi>Altar</hi> of the bloody <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> ſo the incenſe of our prayers, and petitions muſt be kindled firſt by the ardency of our ſorrow, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſinnes, (which anſwer to the outward, and firſt Altar.) From thence the fire of all our zeale
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60051:128"/>muſt be firſt taken, that is, all our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt take their riſe from our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, and when they are offered up in this order, they doe often impetrate more then they ſollicite, for they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not onely ſpirituall acquieſcence, but even temporall refreſhments. We muſt remember then, that this holy ſorrow is a kind of ſpirituall <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> which is the firſt gate of the <hi>Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant,</hi> through which all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts muſt paſſe up to the altar; ſo that we ſhall doe well to ſet this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> upon this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of contrition,

               <p>Beſides the obligation of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which I have remonſtrated to you, there is a ſatisfaction reſulting thereout, which may be very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to many, who may be tempted to perplex themſelves in ſearch and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of the cauſes and irritations that have moved God to theſe ſevere examinations of you. For when you
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60051:129"/>recollect your comportments in the former times of more ſerenity, if in the audit of your conſciences, you finde theſe old debts of an abuſe, and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſſe of that calme, you neede ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy no farther the matter of theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, which was then exhaled out of the fatneſſe of your earth. Let every one therefore turne over his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and conſider reſpectively to his condition, what mundanities, what ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots &amp; exceſſes ſome can charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves withall; others with what ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, worldly wiſdome, and over tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing they can impeach themſelves; others of what indevotion, tepidity or ſcandall they can endict themſelves; and they who find themſelves ſtanding convicted of theſe recuſancies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformities to the Laws and Statutes of <hi>Catholike</hi> Religion, let them not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee theſe heavy fines ſet upon them; for even the lighteſt of theſe miſdemeanours, deſerveth a higher amercement then all your temporali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can be extended unto. And truly I am afraid, upon what I have heard of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60051:129"/>theſe latter times, of moderation and indulgence, that it may be too truly ſaid as the <hi>Prophet Eſay</hi> did,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26.15 Thou haſt been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion O Lord, thou haſt been favourable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, waſt thou glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified?</note> in no unlike occaſion, <hi>Indulſiſti genti Domine, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſti genti nunquid glorificatus es?</hi> And if you find your ſelves lyable to this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, you need enquire no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a cauſe of this judgement. It is a harder taske of the two, the giving a reaſon of Gods truſting you with this ſecond mercy, as I may well term it, of paternall correction, after your having abuſed your firſt truſt of the indulgence &amp; benignity: ſo that while you examine your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, you may not only find a reaſon of your preſent afflictions, but that reaſon may diſcloſe to you this ſecret, of their being ſuch graces, as you wanted moſt. For ſurely if theſe infirmities, (which I may well call a ſpirituall ſcurvy) were growing upon you, eaſe, repoſe, and ſtilneſſe would have much advanced this diſeaſe, and now this revolution, and exerciſe, (joyned with the grace of him that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters them) is very like to ſtay, and cure this ſurreptitious infirmity which
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60051:130"/>creeps in likely into the ſoftneſſe and conveniency of life; and God knoweth when to work upon our nature with <hi>Simples,</hi> and <hi>Benedicta,</hi> (as <hi>Phyſitians</hi> ſay) and when to uſe <hi>Mineralls.</hi> And we find by experience, that this kind of <hi>ſteele</hi> is the proper key to this ſort of obſtructions and opilations in our minds, of ſlackneſſe, deſidiouſneſſe, and indevotion. Therefore you may well apprehend, the hardneſſe of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conditions to be miniſtred to you, as remedies of ſome indiſpoſitions, breeding by the ſofter qualities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60051:131"/>ſooner reconciliate your enemies, by your practicall vertues of <hi>Patience,</hi> meekneſſe, and charity, then we by all our rationall evincements. Theſe your <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> traditions, of <hi>joy in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, longanimity, ſuavity in the holy Ghoſt, ſincere dilection</hi> of enemies, may work upon thoſe, that are never ſo averſe and repugnant to tradition. Therefore as I told you before, you were all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Prieſts</hi> in one reſpect, ſo now I may ſay to you, in this relation, you are now made <hi>Doctors</hi> to promulgate the <hi>Catholike Faith,</hi> by the perſwaſions of your uncontroverted virtues. For me thinks what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in compariſon between the ſpeaking with tongues, and prophecying, may be not unfitly applyed to your practicall parts, and our ſpeculative reaſons towards the converſion of the <hi>unlearned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.27.</note> and <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers:</hi> For they who hearing the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the Schoole, may be ſo uncapable of them, as they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them madneſſe, when they ſee all you <hi>Catholikes</hi> humbly and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accepting all your croſſes, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60051:131"/>in your priſons, ſinging Gods praiſes in the midſt of the fornace, wherein not ſo much as the garments of your minds, your exteriour graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and compoſure are tainted by the flames, and that your zeal and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to your countrey and your enemies are onely the more inflamed, in this your fiery tryall; theſe evidences, whereof the illiterate are capable, may convince them ſo, as falling on their faces they may adore God, and not their private ſpirits, pronouncing that God is in you indeed.</p>
               <p>This is truly that ſort of practicall reaſon which S.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith <hi>every one ſhould have ready to ſatisfie thoſe that aske a reaſon of that hope which is in you;</hi> not the arguing &amp; fencing with that ſword of the Spirit, which is ſo hard to weild, even for the ſtrongeſt hands; and ſo we ſee, how unhappily the children of this age cut and wound themſelves when they are ſo bold with it. You are not ſet by the providence of God, ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a taske as to wraſtle with all arguments may be ſet upon you, (the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60051:132"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> hath her proper champions for that exerciſe) your part is to exhibit demonſtrations of the vertue of your faith, by the practices of the verities you receive from a ſure hand, (your <hi>Catholike Mother the pillar and ſtrength of truth:</hi>) That as the Prince of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> adviſeth his Diſciples in your conditions,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 8.9.</note> 
                  <hi>you may be all of one mind, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of fraternity, modeſt, humble, not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring evill for evill, nor curſe for curſe; but contrariwiſe bleſsing, that in that which they ſpeak ill of you, they may be confounded which calumniate your good converſation in CHRIST.</hi> This practical part of your Religion is that which falls within eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of your capacities; this is the good fight you are to fight, wherein you are not diſarmed by being mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled. For me thinks I may ſay as <hi>Seneca</hi> did of <hi>Seaevola,</hi> That he was happyer in ſuffering, then he could have been in acting; as it is a more admirable thing to overcome an enemy by ſuffering the loſſe of our hand, then by that of ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with it. So this your ſuffering e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate may prove more ſucceſſefull to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60051:132"/>you then that deſperate deſign of ſome few acting many years agoe, which no good <hi>Engliſh Catholikes</hi> doe juſtifie; for by your patience and equanimity, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for your Countrey, in all your loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſufferances, you may perhaps overcome, that is, ſweeten and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the fierceneſſe of your enemies, by the moſt admirable, and moſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> way that can be projected. And thus proving your ſelves innocent of thoſe combuſtions wherewith you are charged, you may become holy <hi>incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries</hi> of true zeale and charity in your Country, by theſe virtues ſhining and flaming in your ſufferances.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of this propoſition to you, I muſt recall to your memorie, that as by theſe evidences of your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid virtue you may adorne the doctrine of our <hi>Saviour God</hi> in all things, ſo there is no acceſſe unto theſe holy diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but through the entry whereunto I have directed you, of humble, and ſincere ſorrow, and contrition for your ſins, whereof I ſhall not now need to inlarge any adviſes, ſince it is a ſubject
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60051:133"/>well handled by every body, though the precepts are ſeldome well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, even with the help of affliction to enforce them. Therefore I muſt cloſe up this point, preſenting you with part of the <hi>three childrens prayer,</hi> upon the occaſion of their tryall in <hi>Babylon,</hi> which may be appoſite in many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to your conditions, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the terrours and comminations you are now expoſed unto,

When the great <hi>Maligner</hi> of our nature, bringeth in ſuch enemies for the imbraces of our charity, we had need have our breſts well ſtored with thoſe flames which many waters cannot extinguiſh, when ſtreames even of our owne blood,

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60051:134"/>ſurely much of that love, which is ſtronger then death, to return love to that animoſity againſt us, which is ſo much ſtronger then nature in friends, and brothers. In this caſe, it muſt needs be ſpecially requiſite, that you who are thus aſſayled, by theſe moſt powerfull temptations, ſhould be furniſhed with the armour of God,
<note place="margin">

               <p>As touching the firſt of theſe two dutyes, I may ſay as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> in the like occaſion, concerning the charity of the fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>We have no need to write to you,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.9</note> for your ſelves have learned of God to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> The remiſneſſe of our vitiated nature in this precept, is commonly quickned, and invigorated by the ſame degrees, that a common perſecution is ſtrained upon us; wherefore I may truſt even <hi>Vox populi,</hi> in theſe times to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60051:135"/>preach fervour to you in this practice.

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.16.</note> and domeſtikes of God, and proceed to the ſaying of the office more amply of the other part of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the dilection of enemies. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed both theſe duties are but divers branches, which have a continuity and unity in the ſame ſhaft, before they part, and break themſelves into theſe two ſeverall armes, of acting for friends, and affecting of enemies, and ſo we cannot touch the one, without ſome report, and relation to the other. For theſe two exerciſes, are but lower and higher boughes, growing upon the ſame ſhaft of the charity of God powred forth in our hearts by the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> which is given us.</p>
               <p>Heaven is the orbe of mans joy, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60051:135"/>earth the element of his miſery, and love is both the conveyance of man to heaven, and the conſummation of his joy there; and the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the raiſing of this our conducting love, very often, out of our conſortings in the miſeries of this life; for ſociety in ſuffering here, exalts mutuall love, as communion in joyes, there, doth heighten reciprocall charity, which is ſome acceſſion to the bliſſe of heaven. And in order to this, we ſee that the bleeding of the myſticall body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath alwaies offered a kinde of ſpirituall cement to unite and compact the parts thereof.

For we know in thoſe times, when oppoſition to this tender body was moſt fierce, this union was ſo firme, and indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> ſeemeth to glory
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60051:136"/>in this operation, as having wrought this ſimilitude of unity ſo perfectly, as he pronounceth <hi>The multitude of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to have had one heart,

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32.</note> and one ſoule;</hi> ſo that here was that ſimilitude accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in them, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> asked thus of his Father, for the beleevers in him,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job.</hi> 17.22</note> that <hi>They may be one as we alſo are one.</hi> For this ſeemeth a good reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of that union is in the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> wherein there is diſtinction of <hi>Perſons,</hi> and unity of <hi>Eſſence,</hi> ſince here, the multitude conſiſting of divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were all one heart, and one ſoule. This ſimplicity, and unanimity ſlakned, even in thoſe times, by the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees that the preſſures which lay upon this arch of the <hi>Church,</hi> were lightned, and removed. But in all times we finde that a common perſecution hath in ſome meaſure ſtraitened and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined the minds conſorted in that band of Religion, which is the cauſe of their preſſure, and gravation. So as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt but theſe times have in a good proportion cloſed, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted more your hearts in a mutuall
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60051:136"/>zeal, and charity towards one another; which unity of ſpirit is very ſutable with the uniformity of your Religion, and no violence can ſuppreſſe a free exerciſe of this act thereof. And as this ſort of communication to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neceſſities, is a means left you ſtill to exerciſe your charities, ſo I hope in God, you are very faithfull, and active in this commerce with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that both ſorts drive a greater trade of charity in your ſeverall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties then ever.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have beene in the office of giving materiall almes, doe now I hope endeavour to compenſate the loſſes of the poore,

For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon this mutuall commerce of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60051:138"/>charity, is that I now recommend unto you, for the exerciſe of <hi>fraternall dilection;</hi> that while you cannot turniſh the Altar without the veyle, with the fat of your flocks, you may the more largely ſerve the table of Incenſe, with theſe odours of internall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid in way of direction to theſe interiour acts of charity, is to extenuate the paines of thoſe <hi>Tobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſes,</hi> who it may be are now reduced, from being almoners to be their owne almes-men, having ſcarce left for their ſupport that which was heretofore their waſte, that ran over, and fed their brothers. But I doe not intend this as a diſpenſation to any, who have yet any thing left which they may pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deny themſelves, in contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the releife of ſuch, who have no portion of ſubſiſtance. For now every one ſhould ſquare his mind, by the new modell of theſe times, and the ſame clay that the potter hath beene pleaſed to turn from a larger into a leſſer veſſell, muſt attend to his preſent
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60051:139"/>forme, and not reflect upon his other meaſure, and deſigne his charity upon his proportion of ſelfe-denyall, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his preſent poſſeſſions, eſtimated with the requiſites of his former condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: &amp; thus, every one ſhould now be the beſt husband of the ſtate of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to improve that to the higheſt rent of merit it may be raiſed unto, which is to be done by ſtraining ſomwhat, even upon their incommodities, to miniſter to the more preſſing neceſſities; ſo that every one ſhould now tax their owne ſtate of ſuffering, with ſome voluntary impoſition, laying upon it the privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome part of what is remaining in their power, offering it up to the common neceſſity; and thus every crumme, given out of your owne crums, will be no leſſe a <hi>Pacifike offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> then heretofore your whole cakes of fine floure covered with oyle, which were then (it may be) the crums of your tables; and by this ingenious way of manageing the fortune of poverty, you may make out of it, the complete benefit of all your former fortunes,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60051:139"/>for thus, you give ſtill all you ever had to diſpoſe of. For you prove mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, that you would ſtill diſtribute what you had done formerly, when you give what you cannot well ſpare. So that before God you appeare offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more then ever, when you muſt rob your nature to be able to give any thing. And thus you exerciſe two ſingular virtues in one act, <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>mortification;</hi> and if almes and faſting in their owne nature, are ſo accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, how much muſt they be endeared, by this ſupererogatory cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, when we are faine to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe faſting on our ſelves to raiſe almes for others? I humbly therefore recommend this excellent oeconomy to all ſuch, as have yet a ſtock capable of this improvement. And though this may ſeeme ſomwhat aſperous to nature, to preſſe her thornes farther into her, yet this may be ſweetned, when it is conſidered, that we are members of that head, who trod much harder upon all the thorns he felt then was preciſely requiſite; when we pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60051:140"/>how he that was richer then we can conceive, made himſelfe poore, that by his poverty we might be rich, can it ſeeme rigorous, when we are involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily made poore, willingly to make our ſelves a little poorer, that by this our poverty he may be ſomwhat more accommodated? For we know, the nakedneſſe we cover, and the hunger we ſtay, never ſo little, is all referred to his ſolacing; and he taſts much better a little that we take out of our owne mouthes, to give him, then much more of the leavings of our ſatiety. Every cup of cold water taken from our own thirſt, and given to his, is turned into the beſt wine of the feaſt, by another manner, then that of <hi>Cana,</hi> for here <hi>Chriſts</hi> receiving it, maketh the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and every one ſhall ſee this kind of Charity, acknowledged in that beſt <hi>ſpecies,</hi> wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall owne the having received his refreſhment.</p>
               <p>Upon this reflection, let none omit this conjuncture of acquiring that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with a little, which in the fulneſſe of his fortune he could not have had
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60051:140"/>for a great deale more; for to ſuffer himſelfe, in the act of giving to others, in other times of plenty, would have coſt him much more, and no circumſtance can more enrich pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall charity, then an intermixture in it of our proper patiency, or ſelf-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſing and incommodation. Wee know Chriſts judgement upon the Widdows donative, given out of the abundance of her heart, and the penury of her ſubſtance; and Gods remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Widdow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> who did not conſult her owne wants, when the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſtood in need of part of her ſubſtance; and we may from hence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive a good inference, for the eſteeme of this ſort of <hi>charity,</hi> wherein acting and ſuffering are conjoyned, ſince God was pleaſed to be ſerved by it, for the reliefe of his deareſt friend upon earth, <hi>Elias,</hi> rather then to imploy ſtill his owne immediate hand, in the firſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of feeding him in the torrent of <hi>Carith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.17.</note> For God could have furniſhed water there ſtill, as eaſily as bread and fleſh before the torrent was dryed,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60051:141"/>therefore he ſeemed to have tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Elias</hi> expreſly, to give an occaſion for the acting of this diſpoſition in the Widdow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> as thinking this virtue worthy the ſharing with the miracle of his preſerving the <hi>Prophet,</hi> and ſo he joyned his reward of this charity, in commiſſion with his love to <hi>Elias,</hi> making the charitable Widdow partner in the benefit of this ſecond miracle, of multiplying the floure and the oyle for both their ſuſtenances. So as we may ſay, Gods love ſeemed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually divided here, between this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the widdows heart, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſanctity of the <hi>Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May I not then ſafely recommend to you this way, of making the beſt of your eſtate of ſufferings, by retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat that is left in your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, to offer ſtill to God upon his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, of your more diſtreſſed brothers? And theſe cares of corne offered up as firſt fruits, even out of the gleanings you now live upon, will certainly have the vertue of that grain of wheat, which falling into the earth bringeth
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60051:141"/>forth very much fruit; for though I cannot make you the promiſe which <hi>Elias</hi> did to the Widdow, yet I may aſſure you as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did this kind of fidelity,

                  </gap>irs, when the acting of our charity requireth ſuch a croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and offending our ſelves as to ſtrain our owne ſufferings upon our ſelves. Then our fellow ſufferers, who demand this ſelfe-diſtreſſing, are in this regard adverſaries to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that repugneth againſt incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, whereby our friends in this caſe, may be ſaid to be propoſed to our love with ſome colour of enemies upon them. So that they who overcome their nature, in this averſneſſe to offend,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60051:143"/>or incommodate themſelves, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the eaſe of their fellowes, are well advanced towards the loving of ſuch direct enemies, as doe violently impoſe ſufferings and prejudices up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. For they are already half way, being arrived at the loving them, who are the occaſion of ſome ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and inconveniences unto them, and ſo the other moiety is the eaſilyer reached, which is but the loving all that contribute to their injuries, and offences.</p>
               <p>And ſuch, who are thus rectified in the ſenſe of the matter of ſufferings, are well prepared to advantage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by all the manners of them; for having their ſenſes exerciſed, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>in the diſcernment of good and evill,</hi> they will facilely accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelves to the meaſure of evills, whereby they are to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, being perſwaded that the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſpirituall goods, are raiſed to them by the ſame degrees, that the difficulties of their performances are heightned againſt them; ſo when they
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60051:144"/>are to ſtraine their charity up to the love of all enemies, and maligners, they doe not deliberate ſo much upon the pleadings, and redargutions of their nature in this caſe, but reſolve upon the expreſſe precept of the author, and Judge of nature, who maketh this love of enemies, a neceſſary concomitancy with all our good offices to friends, to form that complete ſumme of <hi>Charity,</hi> which we are to account to him, wee owe our redemption, paid in this <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> to enemies; and if even when we were his enemies <hi>Chriſt</hi> reconciled us to God by his dying for us,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.</note> we may well be reconciled to this kinde of love, to which we owe our eternall life.</p>
               <p>Conſidering then our obligation to this ſort of love, we may ſay, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complyance with the love of enemies, falls under the ſame vice as our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe to friends; for it muſt needs be an high ingratitude, not to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with that quality, whereunto we owe our redemption, which is the love of enemies; and it was not ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60051:144"/>but even exceſſive charity to us, that impoſed this love upon us, for it was ordained by <hi>Chriſt</hi> rather to aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late us to himſelfe, then to ſentence us to a penalty. And to cleare this point to us, he hath ſet this love under ſuch a relation, as may juſtly make it agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, even to our nature, our enemies being propoſed to us as fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, for it is under that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he enjoyneth us the loving them, not in the reſpect of their being ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>So that when our reaſon examineth this injunction, we may finde, that this excellent virtue hath not ſo much as an ill aſpect, to avert us from it. For when we look upon Man as the image of God on the one ſide, or as the copie of <hi>Chriſt</hi> on the other, either of theſe ſides of the <hi>medall,</hi> are lovely objects in <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who have this double ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of God upon them, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proſpects of averſion on either of their ſides, for this colour of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, is but as it were an over-lay of colly upon a ſtatue, which doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60051:145"/>the forme, and this ill colouring is caſt upon the figure of man, by the hand of the enemy of his nature; the which foule cover we are not required to love, for as men offend and injure one another, they are the devils en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in that reſpect, not Gods images, and therefore ſimply as enemies they are not preſented to our love, for ſo they are ills, which God cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to us, but the vitiating of our nature doth not efface the character of God in it, and that is the object of our love in all men. So what we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to love, hath the impreſſion of good, and amiable upon it, if our paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doe not ſtay upon the ſuperficiall deformity, appearing in our enemies, which exteriour ſuperveſture is the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> artifice, not the work of God; therefore our minds looking upward to God, pierce this veyle of private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and look through it either on the image of God, or upon the figure of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in which they ſee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries they themſelves have done him born with love; and moreover, they

               <p>After all theſe conſiderations, how deplorable is it, that there are ſo many <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of whom we may ſay in the point of this precept of loving enemies, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> unto this preſent day, <hi>when this commandement is read,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14.</note> a veile is put upon their hearts,</hi> for a great part of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are as ſtudious to find eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions out of the unpleaſing ſenſe of this precept, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Law were unfaithfull in the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the commandement of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our neighbours as our ſelves, and out of which this poſition of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is naturally deduceable. And yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved natures of the <hi>Scribes,</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the love deſigned by God to all his images, no farther then the <hi>twelve Tribes;</hi> nay within this circle they made a ſecond circumſcription of their loves within the tormes of mutuall friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60051:146"/>teaching that their loves were not obliged to goe further, then to a correſpondency to them that affected them, and againſt others that provoke their paſſions, they let them looſe upon them; in this prevaricating ſenſe of Gods commandement,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.4.</note> our <hi>Saviour</hi> we know found the people, when he reproacheth them the being miſ-led by this licenſe apprehended, of hating their enemies; wherein he rectifieth them, commanding them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe termes to love their enemies, and to doe good to thoſe that hate them.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who have not this latitude of the term of <hi>Neighbour,</hi> to ſhift ſenſes in, (being poſitively reſtrained, and coupled as it were in this bond of love with enemies, by a formall command of their Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.) Since the ſubject whereon they are to act this charity cannot be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, are very ſtudious, to mitigate to their vitious nature, the diſpleaſing part of this order, by reſtraining this love in the proportions, whereof, they
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60051:146"/>cannot diſpute the adjudgment to the perſons, and therefore many are very inquiſitive in the kind, and the quantity of love aſſigned unto enemies; ſo as now a dayes they, who are as willing to juſtifie themſelves as the <hi>Lawyer</hi> in the <hi>Goſpell,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The rule of forgiving enemies, is ſo much exempted from diſpute among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as they dare not claime of God any diſcharge of their ſinnes, but by the meaſures of their own compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in this duty.

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60051:147"/>in the preciſeneſſe of this duty of forgiving enemies. Thoſe who make little uſe of this forme of prayer, may have more excuſe for their pretermitting this obſervance, and ſo are likely to give you the more occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to remember this duty, wherein your faithfull diſcharge will provide you a better condition, then any have that are ſo truly unhappy, as to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you with the matter of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent practice, wherein theſe times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you the means of exercifing this fidelity in the ſuptemeſt degree, which is in the forgiving of friends, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. And in this caſe holy <hi>King Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> teſtifieth the difficulty, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently meritoriouſneſſe of the act, when he faith, <hi>If myenemy had ſpoken ill of me I would verily have born it,</hi> but when his guide, and his familiar was the tempation, he profeſſeth, that was the greateſt ſtreſſe of weather his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity could be put to ſteere her courſe in: and as this caſe was figurative in <hi>David,</hi> ſo we know it was accompliſhed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the provocation of the

               <p>But alas! too many are proner to follow <hi>David</hi> after the <hi>letter</hi> in this caſe, then the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> after the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and apter to take theſe words from <hi>Davids</hi> mouth,

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60051:148"/>other encounters with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For in this caſe, the blind and the lame doe often reſort to this City of <hi>David</hi> to take <hi>ſanctuary</hi> in his prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for many intemperate aſperities in theſe occaſions.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to vindicate <hi>David</hi> in theſe imputations, we muſt underſtand all the literall imprecations we meet in his mouth, in one of theſe three man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Firſt, that his maledictions in ſome places are by way of prediction of what ſhall happen to his enemies, not in order of his proſecution againſt them,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.18.</note> as when he ſaith, <hi>Let ſinners be turned into hell,</hi> here he denounceth as a <hi>Prophet</hi> that ſinners ſhall have this judgement, and doth not ſolicite this ſentence againſt them, upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations. In a ſecond manner, they may be conceived as wiſhes, but ſo as the deſire is not referred to the paine of the perſons, but to the juſtice of the puniſher;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſa.</hi> 57.11</note> as when he ſaith, <hi>The juſt ſhall rejoyce when he ſhall ſee revenge, he ſhall waſh his hands in the blood of a ſinner;</hi> this appetency of revenge is in order
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60051:148"/>ſimply to the honour of Gods juſtice, for God himſelfe doth not delight in the deſtruction of the wicked, but in the exerciſe of his juſtice; Or in a third ſenſe, theſe wiſhes and optatives of evills may be aſſigned, and directed to the removing, and ſuppreſſing of the crimes only, that the perſons may be preſerved, and the faults abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
               <p>In one of theſe three ſenſes, all <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> vehement inſectations of ſinners are to be accepted, and none of them afford any patronage of perſonall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolence, or animoſity againſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; not under the pretence even of fighting under <hi>Gods Colours,</hi> and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them in this quarrell; For <hi>David</hi> being ſincerely comprehended, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth to us no countenance of any private malignity. Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> (unto ſome who it ſeemeth ſought to extenuate the foulneſſe of thoſe ſinnes in themſelves, wherein they had truly <hi>Davids</hi> precedent) anſwereth, that they who are bold to ſinne, becauſe <hi>David</hi> did, doe that which <hi>David</hi> did
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60051:149"/>not, that is, ſin by precedent, or ſeek to palliate his offence by example. I may then well ſay, that they doe much more perverſly, that wreſt, and bend <hi>David</hi> into a patronage of any rancour, or virulency to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for they muſt be guilty of tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him, as wel as of tranſgreſſing the precept, when they, upon miſconſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vouch his authority for this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of maligning enemies. I ſhall requeſt then every one in all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, or prayers, reſpecting their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to follow this unqueſtionable precedent of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Non nobis,

               <p>Having given you this key to all the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> imprecations, (which may be ſaid to be the harder ciphers, the plainer they ſeeme in the letter and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet of ordinary curſes and maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60051:149"/>I will caſt back upon the two <hi>queres,</hi> which may perplex many well affected ſufferers, which are, <hi>What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of interior love we are obliged to afford our enemies?</hi> Secondly, <hi>what actuall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences we are bound to exhibit of this charity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To give a ſolution to the firſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, we may conſider our love to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in three reſpects; the firſt is, as they are ſimply enemies, and we are not called to love them in this regard, for this were rather repugnant then conſonant to <hi>charity,</hi> to love any thing in that reſpect wherein it is an evill, which the enmity it ſelfe of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies alwayes may be reputed. The ſecond notion under which we may contemplate them, is, in the <hi>nature of men, images of God,</hi> or <hi>members of Chriſt,</hi> and in this conſideration, we are bound in pain of the breach of <hi>charity,</hi> to love all our enemies, and to ſerve them with all the offices that appertain to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of them, that is, not to exclude our enemies out of thoſe benevolences ſpirituall or temporall, we afford to the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60051:150"/>generall of our neighbours. The third maner may be, to conſider enemies in this reſpect, of being moved with a particular affection to them, to ſuch a degree as in reference to the love we owe God, we attaine to ſurmount and overcome the averſion of our nature, and to be touched with a ſenſible kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe even to our adverſaries.</p>
               <p>This excellent degree of <hi>charity</hi> is rather of perfection then of expreſſe obligation; thus much is onely of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity required, that we prepare our minds, in caſe our enemies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſhould demand ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our love, to render them this teſtimony of it. But the actuall conferring of this kind of love upon an enemy, for Gods ſake, without the point of this neceſſity, belongeth to perfection, not preciſely to the precept of <hi>Charity.</hi> What wee are then abſolutely bound unto in the behalfe of our enemies, is, to remit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely all their offences, and violations of us, never to purſue any repriſall or retaliation upon them, in reference to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60051:150"/>our offences, and to compriſe them in all our generall charities diſtributed to our brethren, either in ſpirituall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, or materiall ſupplyes, ſo as not to exclude any never ſo ill affected to us, not ſo much as by our wiſhes, out of any common benefit, which we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe to our brethren, either in alms, or in any other accommodations whatſoever. Theſe are the bands we are engaged in to our enemies by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which relateth to the interiour diſpoſition of our minds to wards them; and ſo reſolveth the firſt demand.</p>
               <p>The ſecond concerning what exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour miniſteries we are obliged to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford our enemies, is partly determined in this diſcuſſion of the firſt. But for more elucidation, we may proceed to deliver it to your further explicated. The particular benefits, and kindneſſes then, with which we pleaſure friends, as all ſorts of ſolaces, and gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are the commerces of friendſhip, are not due to enemies, but in caſes where their neceſſities and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igences require ſuch correſpondencies;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60051:151"/>as when our enemy hungreth or thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, then the feeding and refreſhing him is obligatory; and this rule hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in all other diſtreſſes of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, conſiſting with the charity wee owe our ſelves. But beyond theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of neceſſity, to ſtraine the courſe of <hi>charity</hi> to pleaſure, and accommodate our enemies, is paſſing into the upper region of perfection, which indeed is truly <hi>evangelicall.</hi> The other, in reſpect of this, may be termed but legall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, remaining in the infirm and barren element of abſolute obligation; for the bare defiring not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by evill, ſavoureth ſomewhat of the apprehending <hi>Chriſt</hi> but as <hi>anſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus home,</hi>

               <p>So that though it were in your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to overcome vice by vice, it were both the nobler and the ſafer way to vanquiſh it by vertue, and to imploy rather love, which is ſure to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and to preſerve an intrinſike peace, then to truſt hatred, which is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine of any ſucceſſe in offending o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and alwayes ſure of injuring our ſelves. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who had revenge more in his power, then his enemies had their provocations, would not countenance it by taking the leaſt grain of it in all his life. He ſeemed neerer being angry with his friends, that but propoſed any reſentment, then with the ſtrangers for their irritations. The ſonnes of thunder were reproached of being ſtrangers to his ſpirit, more then the <hi>Samaritans</hi> for being exerciſers of his patience. So as in this caſe, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſeemeth to have provided a cautionary inſtruction for us, againſt any eager promptitude in revenge, under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his quarrell, becauſe the edge
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60051:155"/>of our owne nature, is ſo apt to be ſet upon the weapons we pretend to whet in his cauſe, when we are in a ſharp proſecution of our enemies. The ſword is commonly that of our own ſpirit, and the ſheath only the Word of God, for we cover familiarly our private a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſities with Gods aſſignations, when indeed we rather take God for our ſecond in our owne differences, then combat ſincerely for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes.</p>
               <p>This is a pravity ſo cleaving to our nature, as we may note, that <hi>Chriſts Diſciples,</hi> who had heard ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcations of this deſigne of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſuffer, and ſubmit himſelfe to all ſorts of offences and violations, did never comprehend his meaning in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and never anſwered him any thing upon this diſcourſe, but as ſoone as he did but touch upon what ſounded like a purpoſe of vindication and revenge,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 22.</note> as when he had ſignified to them the approach of his danger, and given them but a little hint of arming themſelves, they preſently anſwered as if they had
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60051:156"/>been cleere ſighted in this propoſition, <hi>Behold here are two ſwords.</hi> The <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and ſcourges, whereof he had ſo often acquainted them, did not ſo much as awake their curioſities, and having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoken before of any offenſive weapons, or inſtruments he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, our nature was as quick in the acceptance at the firſt notice of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of revenge, as it had been hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy in conceiving the frequent intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of yeelding unto the offences of enemies and perſecutors: but we ſee they underſtood <hi>Chriſts</hi> meaning as little in this point, as in the other; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> came not to follow the vitiated nature of man, that dictateth with the <hi>Scribes,
<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:60051:156"/>Whereupon this Sonne of God, this ſelf-ſacrificer for his enemies, hath good right to impoſe exact duties upon us, in reference to our enemies, the which are more his enemies, in the very act of being ours. So as in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to us, he ſheweth the way to this benignity, ſince his command of theſe ſuccours for them, manifeſteth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to them, enjoyning his friends (thoſe that are conformable to the perfection of his Father) theſe three good offices for his enemies and theirs, (which are all in order to the reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and reducing them to a reda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy of him) <hi>Benedicite, benefacite, &amp; orate.</hi> Theſe three invitations he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth towards the reſipiſcence of enemies; he will have them invited by our heart, by our mouth, and by our hand, by being beloved with the firſt, bleſſed by the ſecond, and benefited by the laſt. And in all theſe acts of <hi>charity, Chriſt Jeſus</hi> hath exhibited his life and his death as a mirrour of refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to caſt back theſe rayes of love upon our hearts, as the <hi>Prince</hi> of the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60051:157"/>
                  <hi>Apoſtles</hi> expreſly intimateth to us, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our vocation to theſe duties in this reſpect,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</note> becauſe <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for you, leaving you an example that you may follow his ſteps, who when he was reviled did not revile, when he ſuffered he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So as thoſe who think this a hard ſaying, and goe back upon it, are, if they conſider it aright, guided by their enemies, as much as they are led aſide from the ſteps of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and are made in effect, followers of their maligners, rather then of their maker. For when they are drawn by the example of thoſe that leave <hi>Chriſt</hi> to follow their paſſions, they ſeeme to credit even thoſe whom they hate, more then <hi>Chriſt</hi> whom they pretend to love. Theſe incongruities are found in the paſſion of hatred, the deferring more to the example of thoſe we profeſſe to diſaffect, then even to the pattern of him we pretend to adore.</p>
               <p>Thoſe then who will not follow <hi>Chriſt</hi> in theſe paces of his love to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, muſt know they follow the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60051:157"/>of their nature, and their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, and he that inſiſteth upon the foot-ſteps of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> avoideth ſuch a leader, as he ought to take this courſe, if it were for nothing but to fly from ſuch a guide, and taketh ſuch a guide as he ought to follow, though he had no ill to avoid. How much the more then is he obliged to this courſe, when both theſe are coupled, to follow the beſt, and to fly the worſt, to incline to God, and to decline Sathan? So as by a juſt hatred to this unalterable enemy, we may well reconcile our ſelves to all convertible adverſaries.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> loved us, not for any good that invited his <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> but for the goodneſſe whereof our nature was ſuſceptible; which capacity in us, was ſufficient for Gods innate goodneſſe, to diffuſe it ſelfe into the loving us; and for this reaſon, God ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to have enjoyned all thoſe that we injure and offend, to love us, that our nature might not be withdrawn from evill, by this moſt powerfull at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive of undeſerved love, which
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60051:158"/>gives a moſt naturall cauſe of re-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even to the worſt natures, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt beloved, ſo undeſervedly; in proofe whereof, it was ſaid of S. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> (the great touch-ſtone of this ſort of love) that he was <hi>Percutientibus adamas, &amp; diſsidentibus magnes;</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an adamant to his offenders, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a load-ſtone to his diſſenters; and thus remaining unmoved with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, he removed hereſies, copying well his Maſter, who cured greater wounds by bearing of leſſer; to which imitation you may addict all your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to your enemies.</p>
               <p>But abſtracting from this effect, who can account this precept rigorous, when every modeſt ſoule may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there is more remitted to him then exacted of him, by this generall injunction to all men, <hi>to forgive, and love one another,</hi> ſince it were arrogance to beleeve himſelfe leſſe peccable then others, and ſo likelyer to be ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, then himſelfe to ſin againſt his brother. Humility then will eaſily ſhew us, we have rather a good bargain then

               <p>There is a memorable precedent of this ſort of <hi>charity,</hi> in S. <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> being <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who allayed the heat of his <hi>Catholike</hi> flock in a high provocation, and in a faire conveniency for revenge upon their enemies, the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who in the time of <hi>Valence</hi> an <hi>Arrian Emperour,</hi> had bitterly proſecuted the <hi>Catholikes,</hi> and upon his death, and the ſucceſſion of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> a <hi>Catholike Prince,</hi> the people deſigned to put the law of retaliation in force againſt their enemies; to which intention their holy <hi>Biſhop</hi> oppoſeth himſelfe in theſe termes, <hi>It is not this, my deare flock, that CHRIST requireth.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60051:159"/>nor what the Goſpel teacheth us; let this be our revenge, to ſolicit their ſalvations, who very probably have furthered ours by their injuries: therefore let us knowingly confer benefits on them, who unawares by their malevolence have contributed to our benedictions. But if your minds doe ſo eſtuate with anger, as they cannot be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this benevolence, doe at leaſt the next beſt to this, refer your revenge to</hi> Chriſt, <hi>reſerve it for the future Tribunall, ſince the Lord ſaith, Revenge is his, and he will retribute.</hi> And this exhortation did ſo prevaile upon the people, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned their animoſities, and did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce unto his temper; and I may expect your acceptance of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for I hope you are as good <hi>Catholikes</hi> as they; and I am ſure you want halfe of their temptation, which is a preſent commodity for revenge, that is not the weakeſt part for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it may be eaſier for you to retaine the quality of <hi>Lambs,</hi> when you have no capacity of playing the <hi>Lions.</hi> And to diſpoſe you towards

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60051:160"/>of <hi>Catholikes,</hi> to defend your ſelves by the infirmities of men.</p>
               <p>If you will then ſecure to your ſelves an admirable reparation of all the violences and injuries of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, you muſt remit them all from your hearts, and offer up to God not onely your continuall prayer, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all the merit of your religious ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to mediate their converſion; and if you prevaile for any, you draw out of the good you doe them, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more advantage then from any wiſh that could ſucceed againſt them; for if you bring an enemy to heaven, he giveth you eternall ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, for all his joy ſhall be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your crowne, as an enrichment of it, and that improvement of your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall alſo be an addition to his joy.</p>

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:60051:170"/>it by a religious patience, and by that we doe cleerly evidence our love.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is excellently ſaid by a <hi>holy man, That a Chriſtian who knoweth not how to ſuffer, knoweth as little how to love, for as love is the ſoule of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo ſuffering is the ſoule of love.</hi> God himſelfe who could not be preſcribed this way of expreſſing his love, choſe it from eternity.

I finde one figure in the primitive times, very fit to fet before her eyes, which Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> painteth forth to us in excellent colours, it was a Lady of great quality called <hi>Julitta,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been called by the Magiſtrats to anſwer the accuſation of her faith, and being perſwaded by her leſſe <hi>Chriſtian</hi> friends, to diſſemble her beleeſe ſo

               <p>If I be not miſinformed, there are many notes of the ſame key in theſe two <hi>Ladies</hi> leſſons, but howſoever I am ſure they are both conſorted, in the harmony of virtue in the ſuffering

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:60051:178"/>Chriſt;</hi> for as the <hi>Church triumphant</hi> hath orders, and degrees of beatitudes, ſo hath the <hi>Church militant</hi> formes and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſufferances, which qualifie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one reſpectively for that prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is to be anſwerable to the degrees of ſimilitude to the paſſions of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which every member attaineth unto, in this time of crucifixion.</p>
               <p>In the figure of <hi>Chriſts</hi> life, which is the exemplar of all our diſpoſitions in ſufferings, we find but a little glimpſe of impriſonment, from which we may draw a copy of our comportment in that ſtate; for there is but one nights bondage in all his life extant, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for our ſtudy; ſo as this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemeth one of the leaſt exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and innobled portions of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> by <hi>Chriſts</hi> perſon, but in recompence, to honour this ſtate of ſuffering, he is pleaſed to be perſonated by every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and ſo this ſtate of durance, which hath been honoured but a ſhort time by his perſon, may be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as dignified by a continuall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of him. And ſurely Priſoners
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:60051:179"/>have this particular meanes of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, (the being put to repreſent <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in one of the poſtures which is the moſt averſe to our nature, being the loſſe of liberty) and ſo may expect a commenſurate elevation of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the ſtate of the liberty of the ſonnes of God. And the difficulty of your parts ſeemeth raiſed by this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, of being debarred all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of acting for God, or exteriour worſhip of him.</p>
               <p>This removall from his preſence in his ordinances, is a privation you may boldly pretend a great reſtitution upon, and out of all the unpleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your parts, you may derive this conſolation, That it is a croſſe hath nothing of your election in it, and ſo the likelier to have the more of Gods deſigne, and conſequently to prove the more purgative and depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of your nature, for impriſonment is a croſſe of ſuch a quality, as it is often the moſt proper expedient for our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in grace, and yet it is not poſſible for us to take it, without being

               <p>In many caſes, no leſſe then the loſſe of what we could not part with but by force, which is our liberty, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to conveigh to us, what is better worth then all we could have wiſhed, before we had received that addition, which is, an inlargement of grace, and a ſtraighter incloſure of our wills with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the pleaſure of our Creatour.
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:60051:180"/>Wherefore we ought alwaies to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the deprivement of our liberty, to ſome ſpeciall purpoſe of God, which we muſt enquire, by the beſt uſe we can aſſigne our time unto, which is prayer and ſtudy, and by them God doth commonly (as from under the wings of the two <hi>Cherubims</hi>) ſpeak to us his deſign upon us.</p>
               <p>This ſtate of ſufferance, hath been much honoured by the perſons of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> the priſons ſeemed their Innes in their perambulation of the world. Wherein we may remarke a ſpeciall kindneſſe of God to priſoners, who being not in an eſtate of hearing the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as it paſſed through their country, was pleaſed to ſend the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> as it were ſo much out of their way, to ſeeke priſoners and miniſter it to them. For ſurely ſuch lodgings, may to human reaſon, ſeem much out of the way, to ſuch as were to circuit the whole world. And me thinks we cannot render a more appoſite reaſon of Gods beſtowing ſo much of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time upon priſons, then his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:60051:180"/>grace, and indulgence to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſefull ſtate of ſufferers. For in all other reſpects, this immuring of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were ſo few, and had ſo long journeys ſet them, might ſeem an impediment of their <hi>Commiſsion,</hi> and rather a putting that light under a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell, then a way to illuminate the darkneſſe of the whole world, by the diffuſion of it; and yet we ſee how much of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time God allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to priſons; two years in <hi>Caſarea,</hi> as many interpret it, and certainly two whole yeares in his firſt bonds at <hi>Rome,</hi> beſides all thoſe other interjections, of thoſe links of this chaine, as at <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> and other places in his progreſſe, where we ſee him diſſolving the bonds of his companions, by touching them at his owne, and faſtning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the <hi>Croſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe irons he converted into nayles for that ſervice.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> records deliver unto us eminent and numerous converſions, wrought in priſons upon the ſame miracles, which were effectleſſe in the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:60051:181"/>ſtreets, and the temples; and this may well be impured to the congruity, and ſimpathy there ſeemeth to be, between the vocation of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> &amp; the eſtate of a priſoner; for as the firſt is a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the world, the laſt is a civil death unto the ſame; ſo as this <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> from the world, muſt needs be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous diſpoſition, to a ſpiritual depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the life of the world. And beſides this literall analogy, which there is between being buryed with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; being intombed in the world, this ſimilitude is very operative, as well as conſonant; for this ſtate of ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the objects of our worldly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, worketh much towards their extinction; ſo that in many reſpects, the ſtate of impriſoment, hath much conſonancy with the requiſitions of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then impriſonment being ſimply conſidered, hath much report and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie with the profeſſion of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that durance which reſpecteth directly the profeſſion of true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> muſt needs be a ſtate of very neere allyance
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60051:181"/>to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo may well be congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in thoſe who ſhould purſue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſeriouſly, as this eſtate of their patron Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> of being crucified to the world, when they are crucified by it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I beſeech you ſtudiouſly to co-operate with the facilitation, this your condition affordeth you, to break priſon and to diſſolve more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious bonds, then thoſe which hang but on your out-ſides, ſuch fetters as liberty and proſperity doe commonly frame within us, binding our ſoules ſo ſubtilly in their priſon, as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not their owne captivity. This is a work for which you cannot wiſh a fitter time, to file away by degrees theſe your chaines of all worldly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, which you will find hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, when you come to work upon them, though they are ſo ſoft and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as you ſcarce feele them while they lie intire upon you. And by this enlargement of your ſoules, you may come to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> bleſſing as well as to his poſture, <hi>That your brethren may know

So that Paul bound hath dominion over all bands; nay more, when he ſailed in bands, he ſtayes, and bindeth up the ſtorme, freeth the ſhip wrecked, and reſtraineth the venome of the viper.</hi> Theſe reflexions on the opinions of <hi>Saints,</hi> may direct you in the ſenſe of your condition; for though you are not endowed with the gift of diſſolving bands, and opening priſons, yet if you find in your ſelves the diſpoſition of

               <p>Wherefore I beſeech you all, not to intend ſo much the looſening of your irons, as the converting them into that gold wherewith the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is paved, which is celeſtiall charity.

               </p>
               <p>Your treaſure then is this ſimilitude with <hi>Chriſt,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9.</note> who being rich, became poore for you, that by his poverty you might be rich.</hi> You are advanced halfe way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this compleat imitation of him, for of rich you are made poore for his ſake. But in this part, it may be there is little deſert towards him, becauſe your wills have wrought little upon this part of the copy. The other halfe then that remaineth to finiſh, muſt be perfected by the acts of your owne wills, which is, to endeavour that <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be made rich by your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. This may be done (you being members of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) by your becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming rich in all that ſpirituall treaſure, which may be digged out of this rock of poverty; as patience, humility, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, and the love of God. For every member of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that accumulateth ſuch treaſures of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:60051:184"/>grace, enricheth the body of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This is an honour that Poverty is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, to enrich <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the ſame meanes whereby he hath made us rich, to wit, by our indigence and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, to conferre treaſure on his <hi>Church,</hi> ſince all the opulency thereof, is an addition to his eſtate.</p>
               <p>You need not wonder then, that I offer you joy in this your condition, when your taking it, &amp; ſhewing that you have it, is the means of your enriching <hi>Chriſt</hi> by this your poverty. For ſince you have not one of the hardeſt parts of poverty to contend with your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in, which is, the dipoſſeſſing your ſelves, of thoſe eaſes which your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have ſtill hold of, and ſtrive to retaine, you having but the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of your privations left to obtaine of your nature, may account your ſelves carryed by accident, halfe way to the end of <hi>Chriſtian perfection,</hi> of relinquiſhing all for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And ſurely if you doe now joyfully embrace your wants and deſtitutions, you may be ſaid to recover the merit of having given to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:60051:185"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> all you have loſt. For they who give all away in preference of this ſtate, of the poverty of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> doe not pleaſe God ſo much in reſolving to want, as in actually feeling the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities thereof, and joying in that conformity to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> ſo that your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the preſent diſtreſſes of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, is the point which valueth this condition, and ſo bringeth you to the meritorious part of a voluntary donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all your violent deprivements; and on the other ſide, if you repine and murmur at your loſſes, you doe commit a kind of mentall ſacriledge, in deſiring to take back what God ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to have applyed to the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poverty of his Sonne, which is, the reducing the opulent to imbrace and rejoyce in indigence, in order to an attendance upon the neceſſitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore you may wel accept with alacrity this order of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that if you are conſcient to your ſelves of Chriſtian largeneſſe of heart, in the abundance of your fortune, that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60051:185"/>God out of mercy hath with his owne hand given you theſe laſt touches of the image of his Son, that you might have both theſe reſemblances of him, the having been poore as well as boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull. In the firſt of which features, you know God is ſo much delighted, as he hath ſo diſpoſed the world, that it affordeth him much more of that object, then of the other; for there is far more poverty upon the earth then charity. And it is ſo ordered, as toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the act of <hi>charity,</hi> there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes extant the object of neceſſity, and this latter is often exiſtent ſingle without the other, ſo as you may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this ſtate of poverty and paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe you are now in, no leſſe accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God then that of abundance and diſpenſation to others, from whence you are tranſlated.</p>
               <p>And ſurely you may conclude this your preſent eſtate of ſufferance and purgation, to be fitly miniſtred for the cure of ſome infirmity, wherewith your ſelves were unacquainted. For we have all ſinnes, which are ſecrets
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:60051:186"/>even to our owne ſincereſt inquiſition. We know <hi>David</hi> after his confeſſion,

You may well then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute this change of your eſtate, either to a mercifull purpoſe of God, to draw out ſome worme, growing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly in the full bodie of your temporall commodities, or to keep out ſome ſnake, which God foreſaw would have inſinuated it ſelfe into thoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of plenty and abundance were ſtanding in your former conditions. So as in either of theſe caſes, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve this change to be a mercy, veiled under this myſterie of your affliction.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I may fitly preſent you with this comfort of the <hi>Evangelicall Prophet,

                  <p>GRacious <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> caſting our eyes and thoughts upon your <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and conſidering how by your owne disfiguring, you have repaired in us the image we had defaced, of our creation, we may joyfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this image of our Redemption, ſtamped upon us by our preſent Croſſes, whereby we are conformed to you <hi>crucified,</hi> and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to that ſimilitude we may expect, by but looking upon you glorified. O! let this preſent object, have in ſome degree ſuch an operation, and make us like you upon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> by looking on you in that diſtreſſed expoſure, that we may derive now from that ſight, theſe virtues of <hi>Patience, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> ſomewhat perfected, as we ſhall then partake <hi>Joy, Glory</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> conſummated by that other viſion of you. Glorious <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> who are now riſen from this throne of your humility, to that of your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> give us leave to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:60051:199"/>this your promiſe, of drawing all things after you, when you were thus exalted; be pleaſed then to draw our humility and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity after yours, that they may extend even unto death; that when we finde any naturall reluctancy againſt our croſſes and humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we may feele a more powerfull attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our conformity after your precedency. O! we have no excuſe left, when we looke upon your hands, ſtretched out upon the <hi>Croſſe</hi> in an equall expanſion on both ſides, to active, and paſsive <hi>Charity;</hi> the one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the reliefe of the neceſsities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the other reached forth to the tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all their injuryes, whom you were relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, encompaſsing thus the whole globe of <hi>Charity.</hi> Be pleaſed <hi>O Lord</hi> to faſten us in this manner unto the <hi>Croſſe</hi> with you, that being perfect <hi>Crucifixes</hi> in our diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as in our disfigurements by the World, we may have the neerer configurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to your image; when we ſhall no longer neede to labour a likeneſſe to you, but the very ſeeing you, ſhall transforme us into the ſame ſimilitude. Grant then <hi>O Lord</hi> while we are in this laborious reſemblance of you, that the character of <hi>your patience</hi>
                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:60051:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>may be as viſible upon us, as that of <hi>your paſſion,</hi> and that our enemies by the virtue of our wants, may be releeved in their own neceſsities; while our prayers growing the richer by our patience, we may the better purchaſe their remiſsions. This effect was a grace pertaining to <hi>your Croſſe,</hi> which we humbly beg, may in ſome meaſure be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd on ours; that upon this ladder we may ſcale heaven our ſelves, and open the gates to our enemies. Theſe were the conſequences of <hi>your Croſſe,</hi> and we may (become one <hi>Spirit</hi> with you by our adherence to you) ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsively plead, for ſome ſuch reſultancies from our ſufferings, that being enabled by <hi>your grace,</hi> to ſay with you, that we have glorified God upon earth, and conſummated the work that was apointed us, we may expect our preſentation from you unto the <hi>glorious Trinity,</hi> in the liſt of thoſe that are come out of great tribulation, and having abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of teares in our eyes to wipe off, when we come to be led by the <hi>Lambe,</hi> to the fountaines of the <hi>Water of life,</hi> the plenty of theſe waters have ſtood here in our eyes, may fill our veſſels the fuller of thoſe celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſprings. Be pleaſed then <hi>O Lambe of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:60051:200"/>God!</hi> that we may follow you now ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, through the ſtreets of earthly <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> without clamour, or contention, as we may be qualifide for our following you whereſoever you goe, in that heavenly city, where our duty, and our delight will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant acclamations of <hi>your glory,</hi> which ſhall be anſwerd by a continuall replication of our own <hi>Beatitude.</hi> In the mean time, grant that the <hi>meekneſſe</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> of our <hi>ſpirits,</hi> under our <hi>croſſes,</hi> may extoll the virtue of <hi>your croſſe,</hi> and the praiſes of <hi>your Catholike Church,</hi> over which the gates of <hi>hell</hi> ſhall never prevaile, and the which only, ſhall prevaile, upon the gates of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
